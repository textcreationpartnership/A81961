            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He generall love of God towards mankind is ſo clearly teſtified in holy Scripture, and ſo demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the manifold effects of Gods goodneſſe and mercy extended to every particular man in this world, that to doubt thereof were infidelity, and to denie it, plain blaſphemie: yet for all this, if any ſhall go about to magnifie the common love of God extended promiſcuouſly to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:135677:5"/> all men, that thereby he obſcureth the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall love and mercy of God prepared from all eternitie and beſtowed in due time upon elect men, this may lead the ignorant and unlearned into a dangerous errour: And therefore obliquely to oppoſe the eternall, free and abſolute decree of Predeſtination or Election under colour of diſapproving an abſolute decree for any mans Damnation, befitteth not any Divine who acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth the truth of that doctrine which the Scriptures have delivered, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Auguſtine cleared, and the Church of England eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the xvii<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article. But if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of this treatiſe had no other aim, then the overthrowing of ſuch an eternall decree of Predeſtination and Preterition as is fondly ſuppoſed will ſave men whether they repent or not repent, believe or not believe, perſevere or not perſevere; and ſuch an abſolute decree of Reprobation as will damne men though they ſhould repent and believe, or will hinder any man from repenting and believing, or will cauſe and work any mans impenitency or infidelity; we both wiſh, and ſhall endeavour together with him to root ſuch erroneous fanſies out of all Chriſtian minds.</p>
                  <p>The place cited out of Hoſea, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others which might be alledged, will eaſily prove that Man is the authour of his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:135677:5"/> own ſinne and the procurer of his own damnation, and God onely the Judge and puniſher: But withall they prove as clearly that Man is not the procurer of his own Predeſtination, nor the deſerver of his own Salvation by his foreſeen faith and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: but God is he who according to his abſolute and infallible purpoſe giveth in time that grace unto his elect which before all time he decreed ſhould be an effectuall means to bring them unto glory.</p>

               <p>THe Authour of this Treatiſe was perſwaded to penne the reaſons of his opinion againſt abſolute Reprobation, that he might ſatisfie a worthie friend of his, who required it. What ſatisfaction that learned gentleman, his friend, hath received by theſe reaſons, I know not: but ſure I am, they have given good content to ſome others, who have read them, and do ſtill deſire a copie of them for their further uſe. To eaſe whoſe pains in transſcribing this treatiſe, it doth now appear in this form. If any of contrary opinion ſhall undertake to anſwer or refute it, I wiſh he would ſet down his opinion and reaſons with that perſpicuitie and modestie that our Authour hath ſet down his. Such a courſe of diſputing will gain more credit to himſelf and his cauſe, then voluminous vagaries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout impertinent things. If any ſhall uſe railing ſpeeches, or unneceſſary diverſions from the cauſe, I ſhall ever interpret that to be a ſtrong ſigne of a weak cauſe; or at leaſt I ſhall think it to be an argument of an obſtinate mind, who neither knoweth how to yeeld to the truth nor to defend his errour.

                  <head>An anſwer to the Preface, with ſome propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the true nature of Predeſtination or Election.</head>
                  <p>THe Title of the Book juſtly rejecteth an abſolute Decree for the damnation of any particular perſon: for ſuch a decree was never enacted in Gods eternall counſel, nor ever publiſhed in his revealed word. But for abſolute Reprobation, if by this word be underſtood onely that Preterition, Non-election, or negative decree of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which is contradictorily oppoſed to the decree of Election, the one is as abſolute as the other, and neither dependeth upon the foreſeen difference of mens actions, but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the abſolute will of God. For if God from eternitie abſolutely elected ſome unto the infallible atteinment of Grace and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we cannot but grant that thoſe who are not compriſed within this abſolute decree are as abſolutely paſſed by as the other are choſen. The decree of Damnation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt not be confounded with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of negative Predeſtination, which (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the phraſe of the School rather then of the Scripture) is uſually termed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. By which term of Reprobation ſome underſtand onely the deniall of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Predeſtination. And becauſe the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is to be meaſured by the affirmation,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:135677:6"/> unleſſe we be agreed what is meant when we ſay, <hi>Peter was predeſtinated before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the world were layd,</hi> we can never rightly judge what is meant when on the contrary we avouch, <hi>Judas was reprobated before the foundations of the world were layd.</hi> Some others under the name of Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on involve not onely the negative decree of preparing ſuch effectuall grace as would bring men moſt certainly unto glory, but an affirmative decree alſo for the puniſhing of men eternally in hell-fire.</p>
                  <p>So farre forth as this Authour ſeemeth to oppoſe the abſolute decree of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and the abſolute decree of negative Reprobation or Non-election, reducing them to the contrary foreſeen conditions of good or bad acts in men, he croſſeth the received Doctrine of the Church of England. But if he intend onely to prove, that the adjudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of men unto eternall life or eternall death, and the temporall introduction of men into the kingdome of heaven, or caſting of men into the torments of hell, are always accompanied with the Divine preſcience or intuition of contrary acts or qualities in thoſe which are to be ſaved or condemned; we hold it and acknowledge it a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth. Yet we muſt here adde, that Predeſtination and Preterition are eternall acts immanent in God the Creatour, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:135677:7"/> Salvation and Damnation are temporall effects terminated unto the creature: and therefore the latter may be ſuſpended upon many conditions, though the former be in God never ſo abſolute.</p>
                  <p>The Treatiſe inſuing would have had much more perſpicuitie, if the Authour had briefly and plainly ſet down what he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth by this word <hi>Predeſtination</hi> or <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,</hi> and whether he conceive it to be an abſolute or a conditionall Decree. If conditionall; he ſhould have ſhewed us with whom God conditioned, upon what terms, and where the conditions ſtand upon record. If he grant abſolute Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his plea for conditionate Preterition will be to little purpoſe with thoſe who underſtand that the abſolute Election of ſuch a certain number doth <hi>in eodem ſigno ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis</hi> as abſolutely imply a certain number of men not elected.</p>
                  <p>The wiſdome of our Church of England in the xvii<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Article layeth down the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Predeſtination, and doth not ſo much as in one word meddle with the point of Reprobation; leaving men to conceive that the one is the bare negation or deniall of that ſpeciall favour and benefit which is freely intended and mercifully beſtowed in the other. Would to God the children of this Church had imitated the wiſdome of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:135677:7"/> their Mother, and had not taken a quite contrary courſe, balking the doctrine of Predeſtination, and breaking-in abruptly upon the doctrine of Reprobation.</p>
                  <p>I know not whether I ſhould think him more defective, who in diſputing about Reprobation runneth out into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent vagaries, or him that undertaketh the handling of this queſtion without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing and opening the true nature of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination.</p>
                  <p>And no man need fear but (with all that are judicious, religious, and loving their own ſalvation) that manner of handling this controverſie will be beſt accepted, which ſo reduceth mans Sinne and Damnation to himſelf, as withall it forgetteth not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his Juſtification, Sanctification, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification not to any foreſeen goodneſſe ſpringing out of mans free-will, but to the free mercy of God, according to his eternall purpoſe effectually working in men thoſe gifts and acts of grace which are the means to bring them unto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:135677:8"/> of our Church; the contradictory by our Univerſities and reverend Biſhops (when they were broched) having been alwayes held and cenſured for erroneous.

Laſt of all, if we admit this opinion of conditionate Predeſtination, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing upon the eternall foreſight of mens finall obedience and perſeverance, we muſt of neceſſity grant that the grace or benefit of Predeſtination affordeth no man any help at all in the way unto eternall ſalvation or glorification: which no Chriſtian eare can patiently heare.

               </p>
               <p>Unto all theſe and the like inferences and opinions we briefly anſwer three things. Firſt, That Predeſtination is abſolute, not becauſe it intendeth the bringing of any man unto eternall life without performing the conditions which God requireth in the Goſpel, as Repenting, Believing, Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and the like; but becauſe God in his moſt gracious decree of Election doth as abſolutely and certainly ordain men unto ſaving grace as unto everlaſting glory. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That in the Divine Predeſtination there is alwayes included a preſcience of the faith and perſeverance of all ſuch as are elected: yet ſo, that this preſcience is not the antecedent motive unto their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but this foreſeen faith and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is a conſequent fruit or effect of the Divine Election. Laſtly, That there is a decree conditionall eſtabliſhed by God concerning mans ſalvation, namely, That if any man repent, believe and perſevere, he ſhall moſt certainly be ſaved. But we ſay it is
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:135677:12"/> an abuſe of the Word, to call this the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Gods Election or Predeſtination. For the truth of this decree may ſtand good and firm though no man living ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or attein unto eternall life. But the Divine Predeſtination or Election is ſuch a decree as infallibly in ſome men produceth faith, and bringeth unto eternall life a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of perſons known onely unto God himſelf.</p>
               <p>To ſhut up this Corollary; We do not onely avouch the doctrine of S. Auguſtine concerning abſolute Predeſtination to be true, allowed by our Church, and eaſily cleared from all thoſe abſurd conſequences which the Adverſaries would fain faſten upon it; but we further avouch, That the new-deviſed plat-form of Predeſtination grounded by Arminius upon foreſeen faith and perſeverance, is falſe, vain, and diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the notion of Predeſtination root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the hearts of all catholick and ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Chriſtians. For his Predeſtination is ſettled upon theſe foure pillars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt is, an abſolute decree of giving Chriſt for a Mediatour and Redeemer unto mankind conſidered as fallen, in the ſtate of ſinne.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another abſolute decree, To receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to favour all ſuch as ſhall repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and to ſave them perſevering unto
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:135677:12"/> the end; as alſo, To leave the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and unfaithfull under Gods wrath, and to condemn them as men out of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third decree, Effectually to afford and adminiſter unto all men ſufficient and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary means of breeding faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth and laſt, a decree, To ſave or condemne certain ſingular perſons, grounded upon the Divine foreſight who will repent, believe and perſevere, and who will not.</p>
               <p>To this plat-form in generall we ſay, That the marſhalling of the eternall imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent acts of the Divine underſtanding or will into Firſt, Second, Third, Fourth, is a weak imagination of mans brain, and ſo uncertain that amongſt twenty who give us ſuch delineations of Gods eternall decrees, you ſhall not find two who agree between themſelves in numbring them and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; but where one maketh foure, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other maketh five, ſix, or ſeven, &amp;c. and that which one man ſetteth in the firſt place, another ſetteth in the laſt: and in brief, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ordereth them <hi>ſecundùm ſuum mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum imaginandi.</hi> To build therefore any doctrines of faith upon the Prioritie or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterioritie of ſuch decrees, is to build caſtles in the aire. For as Hilarius ſpeaketh,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:135677:13"/>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">De Trin. lib. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Omnia penès Deum aequabili aeternitatis infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate conſiſtunt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to come more particularly to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius his decrees. Whereas the true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Election or Predeſtination is an Operative Practicall decree, preparing from all eternitie and in time certainly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing grace and glorie in ſingular perſons e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; Arminius hath given us Enunciative Doctrinall decrees concerning the generall cauſes and means of ſalvation, apperteining promiſcuouſly unto all men, whether elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or not elected, conjoyned with an act of Divine preſcience, which cauſeth not Peters Faith, Repentance, Perſeverance, Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather Peters Faith, Repentance and Perſeverance cauſe or draw after them his Predeſtination. So that in the whole ſeries of Arminius his Predeſtination there is not one decree to be found which cauſeth infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly in any ſingular man Juſtification, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification or Glorification.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His firſt decree is very defective, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it giveth us a predeſtinated Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour and Redeemer <hi>in ſeparato ſigno rationis</hi> from the perſons predeſtinated infallibly to participate the benefit of this Mediatour and Redeemer, which is reconciliation and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall grace in this world, and eternall glory hereafter. For as it were an abſurd imagination to conceive that God firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:135677:13"/> to make Adams head, and then by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other decree to make him members ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate to his head; ſo is it, to frame a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular decree for the Predeſtination of Chriſt, and then to deviſe another for the Predeſtination of his ſubordinate members.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His ſecond decree is a decree reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the manner how many in time muſt be brought unto heaven, and not the ſecret decree wherein God from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty predeſtinated thoſe whom he pleaſed unto the infallible obteining of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven: ſo that this eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, <hi>Quicunque crediderit &amp; perſeveraverit ſalvus erit,</hi> might ſtand true though no man in the world ſhould either believe or be ſaved. But the decree of Election or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination doth imply, <hi>per modum cauſae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibiliter operantis,</hi> the faith, perſeverance and ſalvation of a number of ſingular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons known unto God, and cannot be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His third decree hath the ſame fault: For God may (in his ſenſe) ſufficiently and effectually adminiſter the means of grace and ſalvation unto millions of men who notwithſtanding will never attein ſalvation. But that adminiſtration of grace which floweth from the decree of Predeſtination never failed to bring thoſe particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons unto whom it is mercifully vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:135677:14"/> unto the ſtate of glorification. Theſe decrees hitherto concern Cain as well as Abel, and Judas as well as Peter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as yet we ſee in them no decree of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. His laſt decree is it wherein onely the Divine Predeſtination is formally and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially placed by Arminius: and yet this hath as little in it of reall Predeſtination or Election as the former. For, Firſt it is a decree for the temporall and actuall intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of certain ſingular perſons into the kingdome of glory; whereas Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a decree fore-appointing and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring that effectuall grace whereby thoſe perſons were infallibly brought unto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. Secondly, this decree is founded upon the preſcience of mans right uſe of Gods grace: But the decree of Predeſtination cauſeth the right uſe of grace.<note n="k" place="margin">Aquin. Qu.

               </p>
               <p>This diſcourſe concerning Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is neceſſary for the true underſtanding of Reprobation: And it is probable that thoſe who erre in the one are not free from errour in the other.</p>

               <p n="3">3. That if I can be convinced that my grounds are vveak and inſufficient, I may think better of the opinion vvhich I have forſaken then I can for the preſent.</p>
               <p>In the delivery of my motives I vvill proceed in this order: 1. I will ſtate the opinion which I diſlike. 2. I vvill lay dovvn my reaſons againſt it.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt your Worſhip knovveth theſe tvvo things very vvell: <list>

                        </gap> and queſtion in theſe controverſies, and that on vvhich the reſt do hang, is, What the decrees of God are touching the everlaſting condition of men, and hovv they are ordered.</item>

               </p>
               <p>The firſt ſide <hi>(D)</hi> affirmeth, That there is an Abſolute and Peremptorie decree proceeding from the alone pleaſure of God, without any conſideration of mens finall impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and unbelief: by vvhich God caſteth men off from grace and glory, and ſhutteth up the farre greater part (even of thoſe that are called by the preaching of the Goſpel to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and ſalvation) under invincible and unavoydable ſinne and damnation.</p>
               <p>The other ſide diſavovving any ſuch decree, ſay, That <hi>Gods decree</hi> of caſting men off for ever, is grounded upon <hi>the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of their continuance in ſinne and unbelief,</hi> both avoyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by grace, and conſequently inferring no mans damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on neceſſarily.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſide is divided: For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some <hi>(E)</hi> of them preſent man to God in the decree
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:135677:15"/> of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> lookt on <hi>out of</hi> or <hi>above the Fall;</hi> and ſay, That God of his mere pleaſure antecedent to all ſinne in the creature, originall or actuall, did decree to glorifie his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty and Juſtice in the eternall rejection and damnation of the greateſt part of mankind, as the end; and in their unavoydable ſinne and impenitency, as the means. And this vvay go Calvine, Beza, Zanchius, Piſcator, Gomarus, and ſome of our ovvn countreymen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The reſt <hi>(F)</hi> of that ſide thinking to avoyd the great inconveniences to vvhich that Supralapſarian vvay lyeth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, fall down a little lovver, and preſent man to God in his decree of Reprobation, <hi>lying in the Fall</hi> and under the guilt of originall ſinne, ſaying, That God looking upon miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mankind lying in Adams ſinne, did decree the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt number of men (even thoſe whom he calleth to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and ſalvation by the preaching of the Goſpel) to hell-torments for ever and vvithout all remedy, for the declaration of his ſevere Juſtice. This way vvent the Synod.</p>
               <p>The difference <hi>(G)</hi> betvveen them is not much, and even in their ovvn account too ſmall a diſcord to cauſe a breach. Notvvithſtanding this petty difference therefore, they agree vvell enough together, as vve may ſee in the Hague-Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Synod.</p>

                  <p>And laſt of all, abſolute Predeſtination, and abſolute Reprobation or Non-election, do not exclude or deny the eternall intuition of Faith and Perſeverance in the Elect, nor the eternall conſideration of Infidelitie and Impenitency in the Non-elect; but they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch a conſideration of good or bad acts foreſeen in men as cauſeth or precedeth the different decrees of God in electing ſome men mercifully unto ſalvation, and leaving others through their own default to plunge themſelves into eternall damnation.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:135677:17"/> and ſo determining the Divine will to elect him; but the Divine Election was the cauſe which afterwards produced in him that foreſeen faith.

                  <p>God did eternally decree to glorifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the ſalvation of ſome and damnation of others; which the event doth plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate: But for thoſe in whoſe ſalvation he decreed to glorifie his Mercy, he worketh in them the means of their ſalvation, faith, repentance, perſeverance in faith and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by an influx of grace into their ſouls,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:135677:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> by a powerfull yet not violent, by a moſt ſweet and yet moſt infallible guidance of their wills; in and over which God hath a more predominant power then themſelves.

The means whereby men are brought unto ſalvation, are reall effects of the Divine Election wrought by Gods Spirit; as the light and heat of the air is by the ſun: But the means whereby men are carried to their damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, grow from themſelves; as coldneſſe and darkneſſe of the air is from it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>As for thoſe whom you term <hi>Sublapſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> you ſhould have taken notice, that in this number you muſt put all who imbrace S.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:135677:18" rendition="simple:additions"/> by Arminius, as unto the extreme harſh opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Piſcator, Gomarus, or whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. So that by joyning your ſelf with the Remonſtrants, you have as clearly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the doctrine of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as of Beza, Zanchius, or Piſcator.</p>
                  <p>The deſcription of their opinion whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> you term <hi>Sublapſarians,</hi> will not agree unto all who reject the conditionate Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reprobation of the Remonſtrants. For many with S. Auguſtine &amp; our Church, condemne this as erroneous who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding make no abſolute decree adjudging men to hell-torments with an excluding of all preconſideration of ſin: But they grant an abſolute decree of not effectually freeing many men from their eſtate of Sinne, and an abſolute decree of permitting many men to want the joyes of Heaven, and an abſolute decree of puniſhing ſuch mens foreſeen ſins voluntarily committed and voluntarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by eternall torments in Hell.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who are paſſed-by in the eternall decree of God are not by any force of the decree left without the benefit which the Scriptures promiſe upon condition of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, no more then thoſe whom God hath eternally elected are by virtue of that decree freed from the puniſhment which ſuppoſing their impenitency muſt light upon them. Notwithſtanding the abſolute eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:135677:19" rendition="simple:additions"/> decrees of Election and Reprobation, the revealed Evangelicall decrees ſtand in their full force. If Cain repent and live well, he ſhall be pardoned and ſaved: If Peter repent not, and perſevere in his ſinne, he ſhall be damned. And yet farther (not to determine whether ſufficient grace be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to every particular perſon in the world or no) we may reſolutely determine, that the diſtinct abſolute decree of Electing ſome infallibly unto perſeverance in grace and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinment of glory, and of Paſſing-by and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting others, is no good argument to prove that therefore the non-elected are left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all remedy or ſufficient means of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Adam was not predeſtinated to ſtand in the ſtate of his innocency, yet he was not thereby excluded or bereft of ſufficient means of ſtanding. From the decree of Preterition or Reprobation, it well follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, Judas is reprobated; Therefore he will not uſe the remedies or means which God offereth for his ſalvation. But it is not good conſequence to ſay, Therefore God hath not given him ſufficient remedies or means to eſcape damnation, were not his own wicked will the onely hindrance.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> The Synod of Dort injoyned men to ſet down their particular judgements concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Predeſtination and Reprobation; and therefore they had no reaſon to forbid any

                  <p>Conditionall decrees of Salvation and Damnation have been publiſhed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and are acknowledged by all Divines: but conditionall Decrees of eternall Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination and Preterition are not found in Scripture, nor allowed of by the Church of England.

And the reaſon hereof is, becauſe<note n="i" place="margin">

                     <hi>Deſtination</hi> is the direction of a thing unto ſuch a ſcope as by its own ſtrength and nature it could never move un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Thus the arrow is deſtinated unto the mark, whereunto of it ſelf it could never move. Now men are too ready to move in the way of wickedneſſe, and to carrie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto deſtruction: and therefore as God cannot predeſtinate men unto ſinne, ſo he doth not properly predeſtinate them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:135677:24"/> their damnation (for then he ſhould be a working cauſe thereof) but he preordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth their juſt damnation as a recompenſe of their ſinne and rebellion<note n="k" place="margin">Vide Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. ad Monim. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>17</hi> Bed. l. <hi>1.</hi> qu. art. <hi>13.</hi>
                     </note>. So that if by Predeſtinating <hi>ad interitum</hi> we underſtand the cauſing and effectuall working of any mans deſtruction, God cannot be ſaid <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinare ad interitum:</hi> But if we onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the preordaining of thoſe to da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnation whom God foreſaw deſerving and working the ſame, we neither think nor ſpeak otherwiſe then the orthodox Fathers did.</p>
                  <p>It is ſtill the conſtant Doctrine of thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that teach abſolute Predeſtination and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, That neither perſons elected lie under a <hi>neceſsitating decree</hi> of doing well and being ſaved, nor perſons not-elected under a <hi>neceſsitating decree</hi> of doing ill and being damned. The eternall decrees of Gods will take not away the libertie of mans will; and therefore the Pagan objections were Paganiſh.</p>
                  <p>The eternall decree of ſaving or damning men is conjoyned with an eternall foreſight of the obedience of men ſaved, and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of men to be damned; but with this difference: The foreſeen good actions of the elect were neither antecedent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons moving God to elect them, nor merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſes of their ſalvation: but the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:135677:25"/> finall eſtate of the wicked in their ſins, was the intuition of a moſt juſt and merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cauſe of their damnation. As for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Preterition, all men being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto God electing as in the common maſſe of ſin and miſerie, there can be found no oppoſite qualities or actions in men whereupon to ground the oppoſite decrees of Gods eternall Election and Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                  <p>This Authour is doubly miſtaken: Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> in that he conceiveth a conditionate Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination or Election grounded upon Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of mens good actions; whereas no ſuch good actions can be foreſeen in men conſidered <hi>in ſtatu maſſae corruptae,</hi> but as they are cauſed by that grace which was eternally prepared for them in their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, and actually beſtowed upon them in their effectuall Vocation, Juſtification, Sanctification. This conditionall Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination upon foreſight of mens goodneſſe or holineſſe, was the errour which Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine aſcribeth to the Pelagians:<note n="q" place="margin">Aug.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, he is miſtaken, in thinking thoſe ſpeeches of the Fathers cannot fairly ſtand with abſolute Non-election, Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition or negative Reprobation, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a decree of poſitive or punitive Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, that is, of damnation, no otherwiſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:135677:26"/> grounded then upon preconſideration of ſinne. For though God out of the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted maſſe of mankind electeth ſome men unto the means and end of ſalvation, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of his own gracious good pleaſure in Chriſt, yet he enacteth no decree of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning men for his pleaſure, but for their own ſinne and miſdeſerts. And as for <hi>negatio praedeſtinationis;</hi> it is not a working cauſe of any mans ſinne or damnation, though it contein a decree of not working their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie, of not working their effectuall ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But farre be it from God that it ſhould import a decree neceſſitating their perdition and eternall deſtruction. As men not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed within the decree of Predeſtination commit ſinne willingly and greedily, ſo they run on to their own deſtruction volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, and not carried by any neceſſitating force flowing out of the decree of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.</p>

                     </note> ſeem to fetch the cauſe <hi>negatae praedeſtinationis</hi> or <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gativae reprobationis</hi> (as ſome call it) from the foreſeen diſobedience of men, their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is to ſhew, That the finall continuance of any man in the ſtate of ſinne, and his finall falling into the ſtate of damnation is not cauſed by the negative act of Predeſtination: and further, That where men are foreſeen of God as ending their lives in ſinne, there is a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:135677:26"/> ſufficient reaſon to inferre, <hi>Ideo non fuerunt ex praedeſtinatis,</hi> or, <hi>Ideo Deus eos non praedeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navit.</hi> But that this foreſight of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall ſinnes was the cauſe of the Divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of their Non-election whereby they ſtand diſtinguiſhed from the elect, was no part of the Fathers meaning. So that the eternall previſion of ſome mens perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in faith and godlineſſe, and of other mens perſeverance in infidelity and ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, was not the ground, cauſe or reaſon of the oppoſite decrees of Election and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terition; but a proof that there are ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct or different decrees concerning men.</p>
                  <p>Laſt of all, this foreſight of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men left to the deficiency of their own wicked wills, and through infidelity and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety procuring their own deſtruction, is not alledged as a cauſe why this man rather then another was not predeſtinated, but as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain note and an infallible conſequent of men not predeſtinated; <hi>cauſa probationis, non rei ipſius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe curſes may be moſt juſt, granting <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> that poſitive Reprobation, which is <hi>perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torium decretum puniendi,</hi> never proceedeth <hi>ex ſolo Dei beneplacito:</hi> though we hold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall, that negative Reprobation, which is <hi>abſolutum decretum non praedeſtinandi,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth onely upon Gods free pleaſure. For it is no errour to ſay, that non-election or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:135677:27"/> Reprobation may ſtand together with a poſſibilitie of avoiding ſinne and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The non-elect angels had this poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; all mankind generally in Adam had this poſſibility: and yet every ſingular perſon was not predeſtinated. And if God were ſo pleaſed to give as ſufficient grace to every particular man in the world as he gave to Adam in his creation, yet the oppoſite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Election and Preterition or nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Reprobation may ſtand firm and good. The reaſon is evident: Becauſe Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not a bare ordination of men unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life by ſufficient means, which make the event onely poſſible; but a mercifull provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in ordering ſuch means for the elect as make the event infallible and infruſtrable. On the other ſide, Preterition or negative Reprobation is not a decree neceſſarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding perſons not-elect from all poſſible means of ſalvation; but a decree permitting ſuch out of the freedome of their own wills to neglect and abuſe ſuch means of their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: which abuſe foreſeen of God, is unto him a juſt cauſe of their damnation.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>veſſels of Honour</hi> and <hi>Diſhonour;</hi> we grant, that not onely men may but do conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually from veſſels of Diſhonour riſe to be veſſels of Honour. For when any man whatſoever, who hath lived in infidelity &amp; uncleanneſſe of life, believeth, repenteth,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:135677:27"/> and leadeth a holy life, then a veſſel of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour becometh a veſſel of Honour. But if by <hi>veſſels of Honour</hi> you underſtand the Elect, and by <hi>veſſels of Diſhonour</hi> the Non-elect; and conceive ſuch a change, that men not-elected may by acts of their own make themſelves elected; this is a fanſie contrary to truth, and rejected of all orthodox and judicious Divines: who conſent, <hi>Nec praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinationem eſſe in poteſtate praedeſtinati ſed praedeſtinantis, nec reprobationem in poteſtate reprobati ſed reprobantis.</hi> For we underſtand the Divine Reprobation, where there is not a Predeſtination unto effectuall and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means of eternall life. Now who can ſay, that it is in the power of mans will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to procure or hinder ſuch a decree?</p>
                  <p>All the teſtimonies of the ancient Fathers here cited, do not prove the eternall decrees of Election and Non-election to be conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall, or to depend upon the contrary fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen actions of mens will; But they prove two other things, which we willingly grant: 1. That theſe decrees neceſſitate no mans will unto good actions, much leſſe unto wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. 2. That wicked men are not therefore damned becauſe they were not predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but becauſe they lived and died obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in ſinne.</p>
                  <p>As for the poſſibility which men non-elected have, either to believe or to eſchew
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:135677:28"/> this or that ſinne, and ſo to eſcape condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The Fathers, when they conſider that the wills of men not-elected do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all their evil acts freely, uſually ſay, that they had a power to have done the contrary: But when they conſider the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible certainty of their impietie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, then many times they pronounce it a thing impoſſible that they ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feignedly repent, perſeverantly believe, and finally attein ſalvation: Of which man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of phraſe of ſpeech we have frequent examples in Scripture, Fathers, Schoolmen, and all kind of Authours.</p>
                  <p>He that embraceth the opinion of the orthodox Fathers, cannot hold Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be grounded upon the previſion of perſeverant faith, ſince they confeſſe Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance to be an effect of Election; nor the decree of negative Reprobation to be grounded upon foreſight of infidelitie, ſince Infidelity is a conſequent thereof.</p>

At the Synod of Dort, it being ordered by all the power Civil and Eccleſiaſticall which was in the Common-wealth or Church, that the Remonſtrants cited ſhould lay down their opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Predeſtination and Reprobation, together with their reaſons, and ſo expect the anſwer of the Synod; they firſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all reaſon and to the duty which they ought to their chief magiſtrates, would begin at the point of Reprobation, or do nothing at all. And as if this had not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently expreſſed their perverſeneſſe, they refuſed to ſet down their own tenents, and to confirm them; and would needs make themſelves opponents, and put the Synod to anſwer ſuch objections or cavills as for the moſt part were ſcraped together out of the writings of men either dead long ſince, or not there to anſwer for themſelves: with whom the Synod had no reaſon then to meddle.</p>
                  <p>It was intended and yielded unto them, that the point of Reprobation ſhould alſo
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:135677:30"/> be treated upon in due place and time. That which was denied them, was their prepoſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous demand of ſetting Reprobation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Election; whereas Reprobation, being the negative act of Election, cannot be well ſtated, ordered or underſtood, if men will needs begin at the wrong end.</p>
                  <p>It is true that the doctrine of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was <hi>the chief cauſe of uprores</hi> on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant party: But the doctrine of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall Predeſtination, whereby they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſet the rotten Dagon of mans Free-will before and above the Ark of Gods ſpeciall predeſtinating Grace, was it which chiefly offended both the orthodox miniſters &amp; people in the Belgick Churches. And if any were ever bound in juſtice and duty to purge themſelves from crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it lay then upon the Remonſtrants, who were cited unto the Synod by publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, ſo to do; and not upon the Synod, to ſubmit themſelves unto the wilfulneſſe of thoſe who appeared there as delinquents. If here in our Church of England the Non-conformitants ſummoned to lay down their own opinions concerning their Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall Parity together with their proofs and arguments, ſhould refuſe to do it, and ſtiffly ſtand upon it that they will firſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Epiſcopall authoritie, which hath given all the offenſe, and hear what the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:135677:30"/> can ſay for themſelves, it would be deemed an inſolent part, and not ſo long to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated as it was by the Synod of Dort. And yet this was juſt the caſe and behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the Remonſtrants: which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour doth not onely endeavour to juſtifie, but to caſt an aſperſion upon the Synod for not obeying thoſe who in ſuch a caſe owed obedience unto them.</p>
                  <p>And yet that it may further appear how fearfull the Remonſtrants were of clearly and plainly opening their own tenents at that time; When by reaſon of their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy the Synod was reſolved to diſmiſſe them, and yet deſired withall to know their doctrine concerning the controverſed articles, it was asked of them ſeverally, whether they now acknowledged for their doctrine that which formerly they had ſet down <hi>in Collatione Hagienſi,</hi> and ſince pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in print unto the world; not one of the fourteen could be drawn to ſay in plain and expreſſe terms, that he either held that doctrine for true, or that he held it not. If Unwillingneſſe therefore to come to open tryall be a ſigne of falſe doctrine, you had ſmall reaſon to become a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant.</p>
                  <p>The queſtion was not, Whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie of Reprobation were to be treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon or no, but, Whether the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:135677:31"/> were to preſcribe the Synod their order and proceeding, or the Synod them. And then the Remonſtrants deviſed ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhift to put off the declaring and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own doctrine; and that was, That unleſſe they might be promiſed beforehand a liberty<note n="a" place="margin">Act.

Our Church of England was more willing and deſirous to ſet down expreſſely the doctrine of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Predeſtination, I mean of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation cauſing faith and perſeverance, then it was of abſolute negative Reprobation, I mean of ſuch Reprobation as implyeth in God a will of permitting ſome mens finall impietie and impenitencie, and of juſtly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining them unto puniſhment for the ſame: And yet the latter doth plainly follow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the truth of the former. It was wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, &amp; not <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Turkiſh</hi> fear, which made our Church ſo clear in the Article for abſolute Predeſtination, and yet ſo reſerved in the other; eaſily perceiving that Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination of ſome men cannot be affirmed, but Non-predeſtination or Preterition or negative Reprobation (call it as you pleaſe) of ſome others muſt needs therewith be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood.</p>

But if he bring this under the name of the <hi>Supralapſarian Doctrine,</hi> That any men are ordained unto damnation without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of ſinne, this is a calumnie of their Adverſaries, not an <hi>infamie</hi> ſticking to the opinion it ſelf. And indeed it is impoſſible, that God, who by his infinite knowledge ſeeth not one thing after another as wee, but all things together by one infinite and eternall act, ſhould predeſtinate or repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate without previſion or conſideration of ſinne. That onely which is mainteined by the judicious in the upper way, is this, That
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:135677:33"/> originall ſinne though eternally foreſeen by God, yet neither was nor could be the cauſe why Peter was predeſtinated, and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das not; ſeeing it was foreſeen in both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, and made them both <hi>ex aequo reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles:</hi> Which ſheweth that it was Gods free pleaſure to make a difference by Election and Not-election, where there was no fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen difference in regard of originall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe for actuall ſinnes, as Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Impenitencie, and the like, and for all good acts, as Repenting, Believing, Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering; no man can truly ſay, that God electeth ſome men and paſſeth-by others without the eternall cognition or conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of theſe future actions. This were either to make God ignorant, or diſcurſive, conſidering firſt one thing, then another, as we our ſelves do.</p>
                  <p>But the conſideration of good or bad actions which is denied in the point of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Non-election, is ſuch a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as procureth and draweth after it the diſtinct oppoſite decrees of Election or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Reprobation.</p>
                  <p>As for the introduction of ſome men into the kingdome of heaven, and the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of others into the torments of hell; it is willingly granted, that the holy and good acts of the one are foreappointed
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:135677:34"/> and foreſeen as the way and means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God will bring them thither; and the voluntary wicked actions of the other, as the means whereby, and the miſdeſerts for which they are brought into hell, and there juſtly tormented.</p>
                  <p>As for the Lutheranes, that bring-in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionate Predeſtination; No man can look into Luthers works, but muſt needs ſee they have forſaken their own Maſter: and therefore they are leſſe to be regarded when they rail upon the Calviniſts.</p>
                  <p>For the Greek Churches; If they tread in the ſteps of the learned and ancient Greek Fathers, they may found Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Preſcience, but not upon the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagian or Arminian Preſcience, which they make <hi>merely intuitive,</hi> and cauſed by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject foreſeen; but by a Preſcience <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> or <hi>factive</hi> of that good which it fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeth in the Elected, and <hi>permiſsive</hi> of thoſe voluntary evil actions which are foreſeen in the Non-elected, and alſo <hi>preparative</hi> of their juſt puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>The Sublapſarian way of conſidering this high myſtery of Predeſtination and nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Reprobation, is the way which the Church of England taketh, as the more eaſy for our underſtanding. And it ſo walketh in this way, that it maketh Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination an abſolute decree of giving grace
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:135677:34"/> and glory unto the predeſtinate, and not a conditionate decree foreſeeing their graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions, and thereupon predeſtinating them: And by this it ſilently teacheth us what to think of negative Reprobation, which cannot be ſevered from Election.</p>
                  <p>If you embrace the late Lutheranes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and bring within the compaſſe of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the <hi>Predeſtinary peſtilence</hi> the doctrine of Predeſtination which they diſallow, you manifeſtly brand the Church of England with this note of infamy, and might as well charge us with the <hi>Sacramentary peſtilence</hi> for denying their feigned Conſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Orall manducation of the fleſh of Chriſt, as with the <hi>Predestinary peſtilence</hi> for denying their Conditionall Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon foreſight of mens belief in Chriſt. The Lutheranes make Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Election nothing elſe but a revealed decree of beſtowing eternall life upon thoſe which ſhall perſeverantly believe in Chriſt; and conſequently they make Reprobation nothing elſe but the revealed will of God to condemne all thoſe who ſhall continue in their infidelity and obſtinacy. Our Church acknowledgeth the truth of ſuch decrees; but it placeth not Election or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation in ſuch generall conditionate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.

               <p>The opinion <hi>(A)</hi> of the Stoicks vvas, That all actions and events vvere unavoydable, determined either by the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the heavens, and the qualities of ſuch ſtarres as reigned at mens births, or by the concatenation of naturall things and the diſpoſition of the firſt matter, all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo put together from eternitie that one thing muſt needs follovv another as it doth; and the <hi>prima materia</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:135677:37"/> being ſo diſpoſed, that things cannot ſucceſſively come to paſſe othervviſe then they do, but muſt of neceſſitie be as they are, even <hi>invito Deo,</hi> though God vvould have ſome things to be othervviſe then they are.</p>
               <p>The Manichees held, That all mens actions, good or evil, vvere determined too; good actions by a good God, vvho vvas the authour of all good things that vvere created, and of all good actions that came to paſſe in the vvorld; evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by an evil God, vvho vvas the <hi>primum principium mali,</hi> the prime authour of all evil things or actions that were extant in the vvorld.</p>
               <p>The mainteiners of the abſolute decree do ſay one of theſe tvvo things, either, That all actions, naturall and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, good and evil, and all events likevviſe, are abſolutely neceſſary; ſo the Supralapſarians: or, That all mens ends (at leaſt) are unalterable and indeterminable by the povver of their vvills; ſo the Sublapſarians: And this is upon the matter all one with the former. For firſt, <hi>(B)</hi> in vain is our freedome in the actions and means, if the end at vvhich they drive be pitched and determined; ſith all actions are for the ends ſake, that it might be obteined by them, vvhich vvithout them could not. And ſecondly, the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the end doth neceſſarily involve the means that precede that end; as if a man be fore-determined to damnation, he muſt unavoydably ſinne, elſe he could not be damned.</p>

For it is better to derive this neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie of evil actions and unhappy events from an evil God or the courſe of nature, then from the decree of that God who is infinitely good. The ſubſtance of their opinions is all one: the ground wherein they differ is but accidentall to the errour.</p>
               <p>Which being ſo, for this very reaſon alone may this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Abſolute Reprobation be ſuſpected: becauſe thoſe dreams of the Stoicks were exploded by the beſt Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers of all ſorts; and this of the Manichees was generally cryed-down by the Fathers, not onely as fooliſh, but impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and unworthy of enterteinment in a Chriſtian heart or chriſtian Common-wealth, not ſo much for any thing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiall in it, as for the ſubſtance of the errour, becauſe it made all things and events to be neceſſary, and ſo plucked up the roots of virtue, planted vice, and left no place for juſt rewards or puniſhments.</p>

And therefore the objection ſhould have been made thus; God may vvithout any breach of goodneſſe or juſtice appoint brute creatures to be ſlain for mans uſe, therefore he may ordain men to be caſt into hell-torments for ever for his own uſe, that is for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of his ſovereignty, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This being premiſed, I anſvver further, That this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon holdeth not: For there is little proportion between the Objects compared, and leſſe between the Acts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There is but ſmall proportion between the objects, Beaſts and Men, creatures of a different nature and made for a different end. Beaſts are void of reaſon and liberty in their actions, creatures vvhoſe beings vaniſh vvith their breath, made onely for the uſe and ſervice of men upon earth: But Men are reaſonable and underſtanding creatures, able through the Creatours bounty to diſcern betvveen good and evil, and according to their firſt principles to chooſe the good and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the evil: they are the very image of Gods puritie and
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:135677:43"/> eternitie, and were made for the ſervice of God alone upon earth, and his bleſſed and everlaſting ſociety in heaven. So that albeit there be a very great diſtance between God and Man, yet nothing ſo great as betvveen God and Beaſts. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovveth not therefore, that if God may appoint beaſts to be killed of his own free pleaſure for mans uſe, he may with like equitie and reaſon appoint men of his ovvn vvill to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for his ovvn uſe. We reade that God required of his people many thouſand beaſts for ſacrifices, but not one man: the firſt-born of other creatures he challenged for burnt-offerings (except they vvere unclean beaſts) but the firſt-born of men vvere to be redeemed: Which ſhevveth that he put a vvide difference betvveen the bloud of men and beaſts. Beſides, in the ninth of Geneſis he giveth men povver to kill and feed upon all living creatures, but he ſtraitly forbiddeth them to ſhed mans bloud, and giveth this reaſon of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, <hi>Man is the image of God.</hi> So that vve may vvell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that there is but ſmall proportion betvveen the objects compared, Men and Beaſts, in reſpect of this act of killing or ſlaughtering.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is farre leſſe or rather no proportion at all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveen the acts compared, Killing and eternall Tormenting. A man may kill, but he cannot without barbarous injuſtice and cruelty torment his beaſt, and prolong the life of it that he may daily vex and torture it, to ſhevv vvhat povver and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty he hath over it:<note place="margin">Vid.

                  </note> So I doubt not (though there be ſome that vvill not grant it, but charge the Arminians vvith contumely againſt God for affirming it) I doubt not (I ſay) but <hi>(I)</hi> God may kill a man of his ovvn free pleaſure, yea and reſolve him into nothing, without any cruelty or inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; becauſe in ſo doing he doth but take avvay vvhat he had given him: but he cannot vvithout both theſe antecedently decree to keep him alive for ever in hell, that he may there torment him vvithout end, to ſhevv his ſovereigntie. For this is to inflict an infinite evil upon a guiltleſſe creature, to vvhom he had given but a finite good. And ſo is the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon moſt unequall too in the acts compared; and therefore proveth juſt nothing.</p>

               <p n="1">I. To the firſt part of this Reply, namely, That it is more <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer </seg>1</label> deſirable to be in hell then to be nothing, I oppoſe three things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the <hi>[L]</hi> ſpeech of our Saviour concerning Judas;<note place="margin">Matth. 26.24</note> 
                  <hi>Wo be to that man by whom the Sonne of man is betrayed: it had been good for that man if he had never been born.</hi> Two things eſpecially are ſet forth in theſe vvords of our Saviour: 1. The miſerie of Judas the betrayer of his Lord; <hi>Wo be to,</hi> &amp;c. 2. The greatneſſe of his miſerie, <hi>It had been good,</hi> &amp;c. It <hi>[M]</hi> is as much as if our Lord had ſaid, Judas the Traytour ſhall be damned: and therefore ſo vvofull will his condition be, that it had been good and happy for him if he had never received a being: good in earneſt, as Interpreters do generally expound it; not in the opinion and eſteem of weak-minded and faint-hearted men onely, as ſome few un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it. For Firſt, let it be granted that the Scripture ſpeaketh of things ſometimes according to mens opinions; yet vvithout reaſon to faſten ſuch an expoſition upon any Scripture, is to do as Dunſes do in the Schools, vvho being not able to anſwer a place in Ariſtotle vvherevvith they are charged, ſhift it off and ſay, <hi>Loquitur eu aliorum ſententia,</hi> He ſpeaketh according to the opinion of others. Secondly, This Scripture <hi>[N]</hi> cannot in reaſon be thus expounded, 1. Becauſe it is an argument and ground by vvhich Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the truth or greatneſſe of the miſery of Judas, <hi>Wo to the man,</hi> &amp;c. And vvhy <hi>wo?</hi> Becauſe <hi>it had been good,</hi> &amp;c. But it were no argument to ſhew his vvofull eſtate by, to ſay that it had been good for him that he had never been born in the opinion of men vvho miſtake the caſe, but not in truth. 2. Becauſe this expoſition vvould teach and <hi>[O]</hi> encourage men to be Atheiſts and Epicures. In the ſecond of <hi>Wiſdome</hi> vve reade, hovv voluptuous men do ſtirre up one another to <hi>enjoy the good things that are preſent,</hi> to <hi>fill themſelves with wine and oyntments,</hi> to <hi>leave ſome tokens of their jollitie in every place,</hi> and to practice all manner of vvickedneſſe: and vvhat is their motive? A falſe perſvvaſion that their ſouls ſhould the with their bodies, and that they ſhould have no being after death. If this conceit could fleſh them thus in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:135677:44"/> their impious and voluptuous courſes, hovv freely and eagerly (may we think) vvould they purſue their carnall and ſinfull delights, if they could be but once perſvvaded, that after all their pleaſures they ſhall be in a better caſe then if they had no being?</p>
               <p>Secondly, I oppoſe common conſent. Where ſhall vve pick out a man but vvill ſay <hi>(P)</hi> (if he ſpeak from his heart) that he vvere better to vaniſh into a thouſand nothings then to be caſt into hell? What is the reaſon vvhy men are ſo afraid of hell vvhen they are touched to the quick vvith the conſcience of their ungodly lives and the expectation of eternall vengeance, that vvith Job they curſe their birth-day, and vviſh an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times over that they had never been, or might ceaſe to be, that ſo they might not come into the place of torments; but becauſe they judge a being there to be incomparably vvorſe then no being any-where? And vvhy are men vvho are ſenſible of hell-fire, ſo ſtrongly curbed and held-in by the fear of feeling it, even from darling and beloved ſinnes, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they apprehend it to be the moſt terrible of all terribles? Fear of being annihilated can never do that vvhich the fear of hell doth.</p>
               <p>The third thing which I oppoſe is common ſenſe: which judgeth <hi>(Q)</hi> pains vvhen they are extreme to be vvorſe then death. Hence it is that Job being tormented in his body by the devil, curſed his birth-day, magnified the condition of the dead, and vviſhed himſelf in the grave, plainly preferring the loſſe of his being before that miſerable being which he then had. And hence it is that men even of ſtouteſt and hardeſt ſpirits (as we ſee by daily experience) would (if they might enjoy their opinion) chooſe rather to have no bodies at all, then bodies tormented vvith the ſtone, or gout, or any other ſharp and ſenſible diſeaſe. It is a knovvn ſaying grounded on this judgement of ſenſe, <hi>Praeſtat ſemel quàm ſemper mori,</hi> Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is to die once then to be alvvayes dying. This the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Tiberius knevv very vvell: and therefore he vvould not ſuffer thoſe tovvards vvhom he purpoſed to exerciſe his cruelty to be put to a ſpeedie death, but to lingring torments as Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius reporteth of him in that chapter vvhere he reckoneth up his barbarous and cruel practices.<note n="u" place="margin">

                  <hi>Thoſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who</hi> through the extremitie of their torments <hi>would have died, he uſed means to keep alive. Nam mortem adeò leve ſupplicium putabat,</hi> For he accounted death ſo light a puniſhment, that vvhen he heard that one Carnulius, a man appointed to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:135677:44"/> had prevented him, he cried out, <hi>Carnulius me evaſit,</hi> Carnulius hath eſcaped my hands.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:135677:46"/> as the other: ſo God conſidering all mankind inwrapped in the guilt of Adams rebellion, abſolutely determineth to free ſome both from their ſinne and puniſhment, and as abſolutely determineth not to free ſome others; and yet their own ſinne and not Gods will was the prime cauſe of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tormented, though Gods was the prime cauſe diſtinguiſhing and determining who ſhould be delivered and who ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>

                  <p>The root from whence this groſſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take ſpringeth is this, That ſome falſely conceive, that God in the decree of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or Non-election doth by as effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all means intend to bring men to their da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnation as in the decree of Election he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to bring others to ſalvation. But the thing is farre otherwiſe: ſalvation is a benefit undue to any man: therefore God may abſolutely intend the beſtowing of it upon any man, and the withholding it from any man: But damning or torturing of men
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:135677:49"/> in hell is a puniſhment; and therefore the inflicting thereof cannot be intended but with relation to a fault. Again, the means whereby men are brought to ſalvation, are <hi>bona &amp; dona gratuita;</hi> and therefore they muſt be derived unto us by an influence and effectuall operation of God: But the means whereby men are carried unto damnation, are <hi>mala ſpiritualia &amp; voluntaria,</hi> they are their own defective, and depraved actions; and therefore they are not means whereby God directeth them unto their damnation (who cannot be the authour of any ſinfull act or defect) but they are the miſdeſerts which God permitteth them to fall into, and in the due puniſhment whereof he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to exerciſe his juſtice. No <hi>crueltie</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the decree of Non-election or nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Reprobation.</p>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:135677:50"/> but from ſuch a neceſſary determination of the Divine will as could not do otherwiſe. I am ſure this is new Divinitie; and I think it is untrue.

He may therefore without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to his Goodneſſe, in ſpeciall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy prepare for ſome from everlaſting, and in time beſtow upon them, that grace which he knoweth will and intendeth ſhould infallibly bring them unto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: This we call his decree of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. He may alſo without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to his Goodneſſe or Juſtice, out of the libertie of his own will abſolutely reſolve not to prepare nor beſtow upon ſome men that grace which he knoweth would bring them unto glory; and may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther juſtly decree to permit ſuch to fall into thoſe ſinnes which he knoweth will deſerve and for which he decreeth to inflict upon them eternall torments: And this we call Non-election or negative Reprobation.</p>
                  <p>As for that wild fanſie of <hi>providing for</hi> any men <hi>their eternall miſery,</hi> and that <hi>from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, &amp; before he thought of making them, or beſtowing any good upon them,</hi> we hold ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Election and Reprobation, and yet

Secondly, that conceit of <hi>Before</hi> and <hi>Behind</hi> in the everlaſting decrees or cogitations of God hath no ſolid or reall truth in it. The immanent acts of Gods will and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are not one before and another after, as ours are which proceed upon diſcourſe; though in things willed and ſeen there is <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> and <hi>After, Firſt, Second, Third,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of dependence.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> For the objection of <hi>Slaughtering beaſts without injuſtice,</hi> we grant it is of no force to prove that God may appoint many to be tormented in hell without all reſpect unto ſinne: becauſe the Slaughtering or Saving of beaſts alive is no act of juſtice or injuſtice; but the Crowning of men in the kingdome of glory is an act of remunerative juſtice, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:135677:51"/> the Tormenting in hell an act of vindicative juſtice: and therefore both the one and the other are exerciſed according to that rule of remuneration and vindication whereunto God hath tied himſelf in his word. But to decree the infallible bringing of ſome angels and ſome men unto eternall glory, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree the infallible permiſſion of others to fall into the deſert of damnation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to fore-appoint their eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in hell, is conſonant to the juſtice of God, and to the doctrine of Predeſtination and Reprobation, as it is delivered in the Scriptures, explained by S. Auguſtine and other orthodox Fathers and Writers of late time, and allowed by our Church.</p>
                  <p>If any man think that Non-election or negative Reprobation implieth, that ſome men were made to be tormented in hell for Gods abſolute pleaſure, and not for their own ſinne, he is in a foul errour. God made all things for himſelf and for the illuſtrating of his glory. And he eternally ſaw that he could illuſtrate his glory in moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent manner, by making all men capable of ſalvation, and yet by permitting ſome men to incurre damnation. This he eternally and abſolutely decreed to do, by preparing ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall grace for ſome; and beſtowing it upon them in due time he infallibly worketh their ſalvation: and theſe onely in Scripture are
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:135677:52"/> termed <hi>men predeſtinated</hi> or <hi>elected.</hi> And on the contrary, by not preparing and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing effectuall or ſpeciall grace upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, they do wilfully and willingly work their own damnation and deſtruction: And theſe we call <hi>not-elected, not-predestinated,</hi> or (in the moſt harſh term) <hi>reprobated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This doctrine taketh away all boaſting in themſelves from thoſe which are ſaved; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was Gods ſpeciall grace mercifully and eternally prepared for them, and not their ſpeciall goodneſſe eternally foreſeen, which cauſed their ſalvation. It taketh away alſo all pretenſe of murmuring againſt God, or traducing him as unjuſt and cruel. For no man is to be condemned upon this evidence, Becauſe he was a man not-elected; Becauſe he was a man unto whom ſpeciall grace in the riches and height of Gods mercy was not afforded; but, Becauſe he is convicted to have been ſinfull and wicked, and out of his own free-will partly to have reſiſted and repelled the good motions of the Spirit of grace which were vouchſafed him, and partly to have abuſed thoſe initiall gifts of ſupernaturall grace which God had actually conferred upon him.</p>

                  <p>Thoſe who defend the ſtate of man in Hell-torments to have more good in it, then the eſtate of Not-being or Annihilation, ground themſelves upon this main reaſon, That <hi>Ens &amp; Bonum convertuntur,</hi> and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever reteineth a being is not onely capable of good, but is actually indowed with ſome good; whereas that which is reſolved into nothing, is neither indowed with any good, nor capable of the leaſt good.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> There is a great difference betwixt Death and Annihilation. Some dead man may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to be in a bettter caſe after his death then he was whileſt he lived: thus it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with Lazarus; and thus it would preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have fared with Job, had God parted his ſoul from his body.

                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:135677:56"/>
                  <p>Had God yielded unto Jobs paſſionate wiſh, the compariſon would not have ſtood betwixt his Being and Not-being, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Being miſerably vexed in one ſtate and his Being acquit from thoſe vexations in another.</p>
                  <p>Though the Being of any thing is a kind of goodneſſe, and the foundation or rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptacle of all other good, yet take Being <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcindendo ab omni ſuper addita bonitate,</hi> and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with all ſorts of evil, and then there is in it no motive unto appetibility for a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature. This is clear in thoſe exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things which we poſſeſſe and uſe. If a mans horſe have the mere goodneſſe of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left him, and be troubled with manifold incurable diſeaſes and perpetuall lameneſſe, the owner rather deſireth his not-being then his ſo-being. It is clear alſo in a mans bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly members; for no man is ſo in love with the bare Being of a leg or an arm, but if it want the goodneſſe of ſtrength and motion, and be affected with the evils of rottenneſſe and extreme anguiſh, he would rather chuſe to loſe the Being of thoſe members, then to hold them under condition of a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and ſo ill affected Being. And to come to the ſoul it ſelf, the mere Being thereof <hi>in rerum natura,</hi> utterly and eternally ſeparated from the naturall &amp; ſupernatural Wel-being thereof, and burdened with the evils of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:135677:57"/> pollution, of the Divine deteſtation, and of the helliſh vexations, is not nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be preſented unto the underſtanding and will of a damned man as an object lovely or deſirable. It is likely enough therefore, that all the damned are weary of their Being, and wiſh rather their Not-being: yet even to them in their wofull eſtate, Not-being is not <hi>per ſe</hi> and properly the object of their deſire, but onely <hi>per accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> in as much as the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall of evils hath <hi>rationem boni;</hi> and this they conceive will be effected in their annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the very ablation of evils is not properly and primarily deſirable for it ſelf, but it is deſired out of a love to thoſe oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite good things whereof thoſe evils have deprived a man: As he that deſireth to be freed from ſickneſſe, is properly in love with the Being of health, improperly with the Not-being of ſickneſſe: for that which hath no being cannot have a good being; and that which hath no kind of good being conſiderable in it, hath no power to draw the will to affect it. It is not therefore ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Not-being which any damned and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured man preferreth and electeth before Being, but it is Not-being in pain and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which he preferreth before Being in pain and torments.

It is alſo the abolition of all good, and of that good which all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſtrive to retein, namely their being. Torment in hell, with the concomitant evils, is the greateſt evil or miſery that can befall a reaſonable creature: yet it is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſay, that Not-being is a <hi>lighter and leſſer evil,</hi> ſince Nothing is neither lighter nor heavier, neither good nor bad.</p>
                  <p>If this be a good collection, it had been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> better not onely for the wicked, but for many of Gods ſaints, to have wanted a Being.</p>

                  <p>That which is made better then formerly it was, muſt be bettered by adding ſome perfection thereunto which formerly it wanted, or by taking ſome imperfection
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:135677:58"/> from it, wherewith formerly it was incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred; and in both changes the ſubject muſt remain: Now Annihilation or Not-being bringeth no perfection to any man nor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth any imperfection from him, but it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth him quite away from being the ſubject either of good or evil: and therefore it cannot give a true denomination of being better or worſe.</p>
                  <p>As for the rule, <hi>Melius eſt eſſe quàm non eſſe;</hi> it is moſt certainly and univerſally true. For otherwiſe God would never from <hi>Non-eſſe</hi> or out of nothing have produced all things which are into that Being or <hi>eſſe</hi> which they have neither would he preſerve the <hi>eſſe</hi> of men damned. Yet we confeſſe withall, that this or that particular perſon may be through his own default under ſo many evils contrary to his Well-being, that he may fanſie a Not-being more eligible for him then that lamentable and wofull Being wherein he ſubſiſteth.

               </p>
               <p>The ſumme of all theſe propoſitions is this; God who from all eternitie appointed many miſerable men to endleſſe and unavoidable torments, decreed for the bringing-about of their intended ruine, that they ſhould without remedie live and die in a ſtate of ſinne: and what he thus decreed from everlaſting, he doth moſt powerfully effect in time, ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, over-ruling, and working upon the wills of thoſe reprobates, that they have no libertie or abilitie at all in the iſſue of avoiding their ſinnes, but muſt of neceſſitie commit them. Thus they teach: And therefore by juſt conſequence they make God the authour of ſinne; as it will plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by theſe following conſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It is ordinary to impute ſinne to thoſe who have not ſo great a hand <hi>(H)</hi> in the production of it as hath the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by the grounds of this opinion. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The devil is called a <hi>father of lies,</hi> John 8.44. and by the like reaſon, of all other ſinnes; and therefore <hi>he that committeth ſinne,</hi> is ſaid <hi>to be of the devil,</hi> and <hi>to be a child of the devil,</hi> 1. John 3.8, 10. and ſinne is called <hi>a work of the devil, which the ſonne of God appeareth to looſe</hi> verſ. 8. And why is the devil ſo called, but becauſe he doth egge and allure men by inward ſuggeſtions and outward temptations to fall into ſinne? This is all he doth or can do. But God doth much more, if he neceſſitate and by his decree firſt, and next by his powerfull and ſecret working in the ſouls of men, determine their wills irreſiſtibly to ſinne. For to determine, is infinitely more then barely to perſwade; for as much as ſinne muſt needs follow the determination, but not the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of the will. God is therefore a truer cauſe of ſinne (by this doctrine) then the devil.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Wicked men are eſteemed authours of their own offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, becauſe they plot, purpoſe, chooſe and commit them, and are immediate agents in the acting of them. But God (by this opinion) doth more: For he <hi>(I)</hi> over-ruleth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and purpoſes of vvicked men, and by an uncontrollable motion proceeding from an immutable decree, carrieth all their deliberations, reſolutions, choiſes and actions preciſely that very way; ſo as they cannot chooſe but do as they do, vvhatſoever they may think to the contrary. They have indeed <hi>potentiam in ſe liberam,</hi> a povver in it ſelf free, to chooſe vvhat they refuſe, or to refuſe what they chooſe, to determine themſelves this vvay or that way as liketh them
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:135677:62"/> beſt: but they have not <hi>liberum uſum,</hi> a free uſe of this their povver. God doth determine their vvill before it hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it ſelf; and maketh them do thoſe onely actions vvhich his omnipotent vvill hath determined, and not vvhich their vvills out of any abſolute dominion over their ovvn actions have preſcribed. More rightly therefore may God be called the authour of all thoſe offenſes: for<note n="u" place="margin">Opera ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gìs perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ad im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perantem quàm ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Wicked counſellers <hi>(K)</hi> and they vvho allure and adviſe men to ſinne, are accounted by God and men to be the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thoſe ſinnes to which they are the perſvvaders, and have been puniſhed for thoſe miſdeeds vvhich others through their inſtigations have committed.

               <p>The Fathers <hi>(N)</hi> thought it a plain caſe: and therefore they did generally make ſinne an object of preſcience, not Predeſtination, and bent the moſt of thoſe arguments by vvhich they refuted this ſoul aſſertion, againſt an abſolute, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible and neceſſitating decree, as I could eaſily ſhevv, but that I fear to be overlong.

In theſe and many other places, the effect or work ſpoken of is taken from the inſtrument, and given to the principall agent.

Want (Θ) of Wiſdome and Providence.

Want (Λ) of Sincerity and plain dealing with men. Tiberius (as Suetonius reporteth) having a purpoſe to put the two ſonnes of Germanicus, Druſus and Nero, to death,<note n="f" place="margin">

And ſo if God having appointed men by his abſolute will to inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table perdition, do decree that they ſhall ſinne, that ſo they may be damned for thoſe ſinnes which he decreeth and draweth them into; he diſſembleth, becauſe he ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth them under a pretext of juſtice, for ſinne, but yet for ſuch ſinnes onely as he hath by his eternall counſel appointed as the means of their ruine. 3. Want (Ξ) of Mercy in a high degree; as if he did ſo delight in bloud, that rather then he will not deſtroy mens ſouls, he will have them live and die in ſinne, that he may deſtroy them: Like to thoſe Pagan Princes, of whom Juſtine Martyr <hi>Apolog.</hi> 2. two or three leaves from the beginning, ſaith,<note n="g" place="margin">Videmini vereri nè omnes colant juſtitiam, atque ità de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſint in quos animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis.

               <p>And thus notwithſtanding theſe diſtinctions, it is (in my conceit) moſt evident, That the rigid and upper way maketh God the authour of mens ſinnes as well as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> THe doctrine of abſolute Predeſtination doth make God the Authour of mans

And for this cauſe eſpecially we denie the Arminian Predeſtination built upon foreſeen acts of mans free-will, becauſe it doth not fully and truly acknowledge the ſpeciall mercie of God either in the election or ſalvation of the predeſtinate. But for the doctrine of abſolute negative Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we utterly denie, that it <hi>chargeth God with or maketh him the authour of</hi> any <hi>ſinne.</hi> It maketh God the determiner, not to prevent any mens ſinnes; which eaſily he could do, if he were reſolved to ſhew them ſpeciall mercie: but it maketh not God the authour or neceſſary producer of any mans ſinnes; which is a thing as unpoſſible, as for the ſunne to be the authour or producer of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And therefore we willingly ſubſcribe unto all which the <hi>ſcripture</hi> or <hi>pious Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie</hi> have ſaid againſt this errour.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> The compariſon made between God and the Devil is very odious and irreverent; and ſo much the more, becauſe it is grounded upon a falſe imagination, That whatſoever events come into act according to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and abſolute decrees of God, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by an irreſiſtible power forcing the agents unto ſuch actions how wicked ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. But Gods providence doth farre
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:135677:70"/> otherwiſe decree the production of good actions, and the permiſſion of bad actions to be produced by defective agents. Of the former he is a powerfull and effectuall work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Of the latter he is onely a voluntarie ſufferer, and a powerfull and irreſiſtible or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer or diſpoſer. Thus God powerfully wrought Faith, Repentance, Perſeverance in the will of Peter, according to his decree of abſolute Predeſtination: and according to his decree of negative Reprobation, he ſuffered Judas to ſplit himſelf voluntarily upon the rocks of Covetouſneſſe, Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, Infidelitie, Impenitencie, and he turned thoſe very ſinnes to his own greater glorie. Predeſtination is a cauſe effectuall in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of all ſalutiferous actions; but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation is no effectuall cauſe in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of any wicked actions: and neither the one nor the other implieth compulſion, coaction or neceſſitation to actions whether good or evil. And this was the effect of the anſwer which Proſper made to the Semipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians, when they objected againſt Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines doctrine of abſolute Predeſtination, as the Remonſtrants do now againſt ours.

                  <p>I want paper-room here to explain a point of ſo deep conſideration. I will one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay this on the behalf of Calvine, that he attributeth unto God no other poſitive act in the ſinnes of men then the Scripture doth, and in no other meaning then it doth. And it were no hard matter to ſhew, that S. Auguſtine, the ancient Schoolmen, yea, the very Papiſts and Jeſuites themſelves, when they have railed againſt Calvine for making God the authour of ſinne, are at length forced by evidence of Scripture to grant as many poſitive acts of God conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant about the ſins of men, and if not in the ſame words, yet in words equipollent and as expreſſe as ever Calvine uſed. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a weak inference and a falſe collection which this Authour maketh from Calvines forenamed propoſitions.

For the abſolute decrees of God determining amongſt poſſible acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and events, which ſhall be and which ſhall not be, alter not the naturall operation of the agents. God abſolutely decreed to give Peter faith, repentance, perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: and becauſe theſe are good ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall acts, God was the true effectuall working cauſe of them all; yet not by way of neceſſitation, but by giving Peter that ſpirit which made him moſt freely perform them all. For wicked actions, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods eternall determinate decree come into act at the time appointed, as the betraying of Chriſt by Judas, the murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him by the Jews, in theſe and ſuch like the Divine decree moveth no man, much leſſe irreſiſtibly determineth him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe wicked actions: The devil and his own free-will are the onely moving and determining cauſes: But the Divine decree, which for the good of mankind and Gods glory fore-appointed the death of Chriſt, and willingly permitted theſe Agents to effect their malicious actions, powerfully ſo ordered all circumſtances as God foreſaw and foreknew would infallibly by the free and wicked actions of men effect the juſt
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:135677:77"/> and holy purpoſe of God. Where then is the <hi>irreſiſtible neceſsitation of mans will,</hi> which this Authour alwayes preſumeth (and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver goeth about to prove) muſt needs fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon Gods abſolute decrees of infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly working good actions in the elect, and abſolutely permitting and powerfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing of all the future bad actions which devils or men ſhall commit to the end of the world?</p>

It is therefore clear, that according to the doctrine of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants, Predeſtination or Election is no cauſe of any mans converſion: For an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect foreſeen is never cauſed by that which followeth after it, but is rather the cauſe of that previſion, and of what is conſequently done thereupon.</p>

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:135677:80"/> though God never abſolutely decreed the converſion of Judas, or the making him a faithfull and perſeverant Chriſtian. Thus ſay the Remonſtrants.

Juſt ſo he left the converſion of Judas, and upon the ſelf-ſame terms he had decreed the ſalvation and the predeſtination of Judas. But to urge this no further: God doth much more in procuring the ſalvation of Peter then he did for procuring the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Judas. And as for the procuring and working the impenitency or infidelity of reprobates, God doth not at all work any vitious diſpoſitions or defective and ſinfull actions in ſuch men. Wicked habits or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions are diſeaſes bred within mens own ſouls, not infuſed into them by the Phyſician of our ſouls: Wicked and ſinfull actions are the productions of their own corrupted free-will, and not produced by any Divine operation working in them: for it is onely in good and holy actions that God
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:135677:80"/> giveth us both the will and the deed.

The difference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which God in the courſe of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence taketh with the Elect and with the Non-elect is as different as poſſibly can be imagined.

                  <p>As for the finall ſinnes and damnation of the Reprobate, the providence of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth them both, whereas he could (as he doth in his Elect) hinder the one, and prevent the other.

Now becauſe the evil of ſinne cannot fall under the Divine cauſalitie or operation, the Fathers granted a <hi>preſcience</hi> in God of all mens ſinnes, but truly denied a <hi>Predeſtination</hi> of any mans ſins, and as truly a <hi>neceſsitation</hi> or <hi>neceſsitating decree</hi> forcing any man unto ſin. But what of all this? If there be no decree of Predeſtination forcing men unto ſin, is there therefore no decree of negative Reprobation or Non-election, reſolving to permit ſome final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſinne and eternally to periſh? Is there no decree of abſolute Predeſtination, not permitting others out of their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective will finally to continue in ſinne and periſh, and abſolutely reſolving to draw them out of the ſtate of ſinne, and advance them to the ſtate of glory?</p>
                  <p>I conclude, that unleſſe this Authour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>abſolute Reprobation</hi> mean the abſolute judiciary decree of Damnation, and an abſolute decree of neceſſitating men unto the deſerts of their damnation, he hath ſaid nothing at all to evince that abſolute

If he mean ſuch a decree when he fighteth againſt abſolute Reprobation, he fighteth with his own ſhadow, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth that which no judicious Divine will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to uphold.</p>

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:135677:83"/> decree of Reprobation is not a decree to work any mans ſinfull actions whereby he incurreth damnation, but to let them come to paſſe by the free operation of his own will. This Diſtinction of Gods decrees is not denied; but it is objected by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, That God <hi>ſtandeth in no need of mans ſinne for ſetting forth of his glorie;</hi> as if the doctrine of the Supralapſarians concerning abſolute Election and abſolute Non-electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Reprobation made ſinne ſo abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly needfull that Gods glory muſt ſuffer an eclipſe if ſinnes be not committed by his own procuring and working. But abſolute Reprobation implieth onely, that God knew he could turn the ſinnes of men and angels (yea and their damnation) unto his own glorie; and that he decreed ſo to do in ſome, not out of any neceſſitie of ſetting forth his glorie by permitting or puniſhing their ſinnes, but out of his Free-will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining ſo to manifeſt his glorie. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which eternally and eſſentially belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto God, needeth not the creature it ſelf, much leſſe then the ſinne of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Gods glorie had been the ſame that it is if man had never been made; and ſo conſequently if he had never ſinned, if he had never been condemned unto Hell for ſinne. Nay further, if no man had ever been elected, ſanctified, or ſaved, Gods glorie is a
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:135677:83"/> thing w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> could not poſſibly have been leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened or any way blemiſhed. The outward and temporall manifeſtation of Gods glorie being in it ſelf a thing of no neceſſitie in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of God, it is fond to imagine that God ſtandeth in need of any ſuch means for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-forth of his glory, ſeeing the very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ſetting-forth of his glory is a thing no way needfull unto him. We agree therefore, that God ſtands in no need of ſin either for his glory as it is conſidered in it ſelf, or as it is to be manifeſted unto the creature: For God in his infinite wiſdome could (without the permiſſion of ſin) have found means enough for ſufficient illuſtration of his own glory.</p>
                  <p>Two other reaſons are aſſigned by this Authour of the permiſſion of ſinne: The one is, the great <hi>good</hi> which the moſt wiſe God foreſeeth he can, and the moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God determineth that he will <hi>bring out of the evil</hi> actions of men. The other is, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe man is by God made a free Creature, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in his actions till he determine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and therefore may not be hindered from ſinning by omnipotencie.</hi> The former rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we gainſay not: The latter is neither fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor truly ſet down. The full reaſon is, Becauſe God who gave man a Free and yet a defective will, hath thought it fit that this will ſhould produ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:135677:84"/> as well as the freedome ſhould be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted. Now had not God eſtabliſhed any ſuch permiſſive decree, the frailtie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie of the Creatures free-will could not have been diſcovered either in men or angels. Now it is falſe (which is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and here implied) that Gods determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of mans will unto every particular action is a neceſſary hindering of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the will unto all actions ſo predeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. The Jeſuites themſelves, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Dominicanes in their Phyſicall De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination or Predefinition of mans will unto all acts of what kind ſoever, do not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding grant a Predefinition or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determination unto good ſupernaturall acts, and that without all impeachment to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of mans will. To think therefore that God ſhould <hi>repent his own ordinance</hi> concerning mans libertie unleſſe he leave all his actions unto himſelf undetermined, and that Gods permiſſive decree is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this reaſon, is a flat miſtake.</p>
                  <p>And here I muſt adde unto what hath been ſaid, That the Divine permiſſion which adhereth unto the decree of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation may be underſtood two wayes.

                  <p>This is ſo clear that it is here confeſſed, that ſuch a Permiſſive decree is <hi>truly and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradistinguiſhed to an Operative decree.</hi> But it is objected, that the Defenders of the abſolute decree <hi>in ſinfull events aſcribe more to the</hi> operative <hi>power of God then this permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion importeth.</hi> How is this proved?</p>
                  <p n="1">I.

But how farre forth is this energeticall will or decree converſant about ſinfull actions whoſe event is decreed by a permiſſive will or decree?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It eternally decreeth and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly at the very time when ſinfull actions are committed it giveth the ſinner the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and uſe of underſtanding and Free-will, without which he could not ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God thereby eternally decreed to concurre, and accordingly at the inſtant doth concurre, <hi>ad materialem actionem pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> which otherwiſe could not come into act or being.</p>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:135677:85"/>
                  <p>Thirdly God alſo decreed to make a collection and concurrence of thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and occaſions (good alwayes as they come from God) whereupon God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that the ſinner would infallibly fall into ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God decreed to denie all ſuch means as in his infinite wiſdome he knew would have prevented ſuch ſinnes, and to afford them onely ſuch means as he certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knoweth they will voluntarily abuſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the committing of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, God limiteth and ordereth their ſins, that they ſhall break forth in no other meaſure, at no other time, upon no other perſons, then himſelf hath fore-appointed.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, God ordereth all the permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſinnes of the reprobate to his own glory and the good of his elect.</p>
                  <p>All theſe may in a good ſenſe be called operative decrees or volitions of God, and not barely permiſſive: In all theſe which are converſant about the ſinnes of men, there is a poſitive will of God which doth not onely permit men to work their ſinfull acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but above and in thoſe ſinfull actions hath his own good and holy work. And this is that Energeticall will which Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Beza attribute unto God in mens ſinfull actions; which their very adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are forced to acknowledge. As for any
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:135677:86"/> energeticall will which ſhould ſo have a working in ſinfull actions as that it ſhould be the cauſe <hi>quòd talis actio ſit cum tali de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectu,</hi> or (in plainer terms) that ſhould work the contrariety or repugnancy of the ſinners will unto the law of God, this Calvine and Beza utterly diſclaim. And as for the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry terms which they uſe in referring ſinfull actions unto the will of God, the very ſame in ſubſtance are uſed by all other Divines, though ſome in words are more ſtrict then others.

                  <p>Calvine and Beza then might well <hi>tax</hi> all who grant onely a permiſſive decree
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:135677:86"/> concerning the events of ſinne, and deny an operative, and truly avouch that many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Scripture cannot be underſtood of a bare <hi>permiſsion,</hi> but of neceſſity they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſome kind of effectuall operation.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. It is further objected, That the maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Q"/> of abſolute Reprobation, though they <hi>admit the name of a permiſsive</hi> decree, yet <hi>they corrupt the meaning:</hi> For whereas <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion is an act of Gods conſequent or judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary will,</hi> they make it <hi>an act of Gods antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will exerciſed about thoſe who</hi> as yet <hi>lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no guilt of ſinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true that there is ſuch a permiſſion as this Authour ſpeaketh of, which is judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and layeth hold onely upon thoſe who have long abuſed the mercies of God: but he is deceived in thinking that no decree of Divine permiſſion can be <hi>antecedent unto the guilt of ſinne.</hi> The Non-elect angels were permitted to commit their firſt ſinne; which could not poſsibly be a judiciary permiſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in puniſhment of any former ſinne. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam and Eve were permitted to fall into their firſt tranſgreſsion; which permiſſion cannot without evident abſurdity be dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from any foregoing or foreſeen ſinne of theirs. And to ſpeak generally of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not-elected, the permiſſive decree of their finall perſeverance in ſinne muſt in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be antecedent to the abſolute previſion<pb n="166" facs="tcp:135677:87"/> of their impenitency. And though God may juſtly decree to puniſh the abuſers of their free-will by letting them fall from one ſinne to another, yet there can be no one ſinne inſiſted upon in which the permiſsive decree of God is not antecedent to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the ſame ſinne.</p>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:135677:87"/> the permiſsive decree which cohereth unto Non-election or negative Reprobation to be a judiciary decree, that it needeth no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confutation.</p>
                  <p>He further telleth us, That <hi>Permiſsion is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="R"/> no more then a not-hindering of men from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that are able to ſtand, and ſuppoſeth a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of not-ſinning:</hi> But thoſe who defend abſolute Reprobation make it <hi>a withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of grace needfull for the avoiding of ſinne, and ſo including a neceſsitie of ſinning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this diſpute about abſolute Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Reprobation or Non-election, we are not to regard what every particular Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour ſaith or writeth, but what is in deed and truth a conſequent of the doctrine it ſelf. And firſt we anſwer, That the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsive decree upon which Reprobation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth conteineth in it ſomewhat more then a bare not-hindering of men to fall into ſinne, though it be no reall poſitive efficient or working cauſe of their ſinne. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as God hath infinite wayes whereby he could prevent the ſinnes of any Reprobate perſon, and that without forcing their free-will, it conteineth a poſitive and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſolution of denying them all ſuch grace as he knoweth would prove effectuall to their ſalvation were it afforded them. And which is more, it conteineth a poſitive de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of putting them into ſuch circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:135677:88"/> conditions or occaſions as God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth will infallibly induce them to ſinne. This is not done by a bare permiſsion, but by ſome kind of operation. And this is out of all queſtion amongſt judicious Divines whether Proteſtants or Papiſts. And yet withall they maintein, that men thus repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and thus permitted to fall into finall impenitency, thus placed by Divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in circumſtances and conditions which he knoweth will by them infallibly be abuſed unto ſinne and obſtinacy in ſinne, were not thereby ſpoiled of their poſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſtanding, or of their poſsibility of not committing this or that ſinne permitted. The Reprobation therefore which is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined by orthodox Divines, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion thereunto annexed, importeth not a withholding of grace abſolutely neceſſary for the avoiding of ſinnes ſo permitted, much leſſe a neceſſitating of ſinners unto their ſeverall ſinnes, but a withholding of all grace which would be <hi>de facto</hi> effectuall unto the avoidance of ſinne, and ſuch an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of circumſtances and occaſions as God certainly knoweth will make them freely runne into their ſinnes and obſtinately continue in them.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas it is further objected, that <hi>from the withdrawing of ſuch grace ſinne muſt needs follow;</hi> we anſwer, That ſinne doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:135677:88" rendition="simple:additions"/> follow upon this Reprobation, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, and withholding of effectuall grace; yet not an as effect floweth from the proper and true cauſe, but as a Conſequent is deducted out of an Antecedent, by a true form of reaſoning. As for example, if we reaſon thus, <hi>God abſolutely decreed to withhold from the non-elect angels all ſuch effectuall grace as he knew would have upheld them, and without which he knew infallibly that they would fall away; and he further decreed to permit them to fall away: Therefore God by theſe his decrees neceſſarily cauſed their ſinne,</hi> it is a falſe collection or inference. But thus to argue, <hi>God abſolutely decreed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore their ſinne and voluntary apostaſie certainly followed neceſsitate infallibilitatis,</hi> this is a true inference.</p>
                  <p>That which occaſioned the Remonſtrants errour in this point, is an equivocation in the word <hi>Cauſe</hi> or <hi>Cauſing.</hi> For one may be ſaid to be the cauſe of ſuch an evil action or event, really, truly, and properly, when he doth directly work the production of that evil; or abuſively, improperly, and falſely, when he doth not work as he could to the preventing and hindering of ſuch an event.

                  <p n="2">2. And further we ſay, That this Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or Permiſsion whereof we ſpeak in this controverſie concerning abſolute or conditionate Election &amp; Non-election, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth not a Subtraction of any graces or helps obteined, much leſſe of any abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to the preventing of ſinne; but a Non-preparation, a Non-donation of ſuch graces and helps without which God foreſaw and foreknew that the Reprobates out of their own free and perverſe will would infallibly delight and periſh in their ſinnes. The Subtraction of ſome meaſure of grace already given, and permiſsion of a man to fall into more ſinnes, in puniſhment of a former ſinne voluntarily committed, is not alwayes a ſigne of Reprobation, nor of the permiſsive decree thereunto appendent. For many of the elect have thus been permitted to fall from one ſinne into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as David was from adultery unto mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and yet at length all turned to his greater good. But when we ſpeak of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion inſeparably and properly belonging to the Non-elect, it is not a Subduction of needfull grace <hi>in poenam peccati,</hi> much leſſe a working of any malicious qualitie in them whereby they are neceſsitated to ſinne, but a Not-preparation or Non-donation of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:135677:89"/> ſuch grace without which God knoweth moſt infallibly that they will live and die in their ſinnes. And this is it which S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine intended when he ſaid, <hi>Deo repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bante non irrogatur aliquid quo homo fit dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, ſed tantùm non erogatur quo fiat melior.</hi>

                  <p>For the ſaying of learned Whitaker, it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> true, the permiſsive decree, as it properly concerneth Reprobation, being nothing elſe but a negation of all ſuch gracious helps <hi>quibus poſitis peccatum impediretur:</hi> which muſt be underſtood of finall ſinne, if it be applied unto the permiſsion which is onely proper to the Non-elect: For the Elect of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes are denied ſuch helps, which if they had been afforded, this or that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſinne had certainly been prevented; and the Non-elect may have ſuch help of grace afforded them, whereby they do actually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void this or that ſinne, unto the committing whereof they were before ſtrongly inclined.</p>

                  <p>We anſwer, It is very true, the means which bring reprobated men unto their da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnation are ſinfull actions conſidered as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or as repugnant to the law of God, and not conſidered barely and abſtractively as actions: But we deny that the decree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation maketh God a cauſe of thoſe means or wicked actions whereby men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their own damnation. For though Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination maketh God a proper efficient cauſe of thoſe means whereby men are brought to ſalvation, becauſe they are good, holy, ſupernaturall acts; yet Reprobation maketh not God the cauſe efficient of thoſe means which carry men unto damnation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are evil, impure, defective acts, &amp; ſuch as it is repugnant to the very eſſence and nature of God to be a cauſer of them.

For example; The theft of the Sabeans and Chaldeans was a ſinne, as it was a wilfull and free taking away of another mans goods, proceeding from their own will, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the will or law of God: and thus their own malice and not any influx of God into their will cauſed this ſinnefull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed act: But the ſame ſinnefull outward act materially conſidered might be a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of Job, an exerciſe of his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and an experiment of his virtue unto the ſetting forth of Gods glory: and in theſe regards God taketh upon him the cauſing of it; <hi>Deus dedit, Deus abſtulit.</hi> The defiling of Davids concubines by Abſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lom, as it was a ſinne contrary to Gods expreſſe law, had no other true cauſe then the defective free-will of Abſalom who committed it: But as it was a juſt puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of David for his former defiling the wife of Uriah, God maketh it his proper act and deed;<note place="margin">2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.11, 12.</note>

                  <p>Whereas it is objected, That <hi>a good end cannot moralize a bad action, becauſe the evil of ſinne is greater then any good can come by ſinne;</hi> it is true, if the bad action and the good end be both referred onely to the ſinner: But if the badneſſe of the action be referred onely to the ſinner as the proper

Neither is the evil of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſinne greater then the good which God can extract out of it (for then he would never permit it) though it be greater then any good which a ſinnefull man doth intend by it.

               <p>Out of theſe teſtimonies layd together may be collected three things. 1. That the Ancients did uſe to call a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of humane actions good and bad by the name of <hi>deſtinie,</hi> from vvhat externall cauſe ſoever this neceſſitie did ariſe. 2. That they did uſe theſe tvvo words, <hi>Neceſsitie</hi> and <hi>compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> promiſcuouſly: and therefore thought that neceſſitie as vvell as compulſion did take avvay the vvills libertie. 3. (Which is for our preſent purpoſe) That they believed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the judgements of God on ſinners could not be juſt, if they vvere held by the adamantine chains of any abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſitie under the povver of their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>I vvill therefore conclude this argument vvith the vvords of Epiphanius vvriting of the errour of the Phariſees, vvho be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the immortalitie of the ſoul and the reſurrection of the dead, and yet held that all things come to paſſe by neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:<note n="t" place="margin">

                  <hi>It is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a point of extreme ignorance or madneſſe rather, for him that confeſſeth the reſurrection of the dead, and the great day appointed for the revelation of Gods righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous judgement, to ſay that there is any deſtinie,</hi> any neceſſitie in mens actions. <hi>For how can the righteous judgement of God and Deſtinie comply and ſtand together?</hi> And (let me adde) hovv can the belief of this and true pietie ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? For vvhere this perſvvaſion, That mens ſinnes are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and that therefore there can be no righteous judgement, is rooted in, religion vvill quickly be rooted out.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. It tendeth to religions overthrovv, becauſe it maketh the vvhole circle of a mans life but a mere Deſtinie. By it all our doings are Gods ordinances, all our imaginations branches of his Predeſtination, and all events in Kingdomes and Common-vveals the neceſſarie iſſues of the Divine decree: All things vvhatſoever, though they ſeem to do ſomevvhat, yet (by this opinion) they do indeed juſt nothing: The beſt lavvs reſtrain not one offender; the ſvveeteſt rewards promote not one virtue; the povverfulleſt ſermons convert not one ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the humbleſt devotions divert not one calamitie; the ſtrongeſt endeavours in things of any nature vvhatſoever, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect no more then vvould be done without them: but the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitating over-ruling decree of God doth all.

                  <p>THis Authours diſcourſe concerning this <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſecond Inconvenience, which is the <hi>Overthrow of</hi> all <hi>true religion and government amongſt men,</hi> and is divided into ſeverall branches (taking up ſix pages at the leaſt) is briefly anſwered thus; That whatſoever he hath diſcourſed concerning Fatall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie and Coaction of mens wills following upon the abſolute decrees of Predeſtination and Reprobation, is a vain fanſie of his own, a beggerly <hi>Petitio principii,</hi> which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knoweth not how to prove, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:135677:101"/> goeth about it. Let him prove that abſolute Predeſtination and abſolute Non-predeſtination or negative Reprobation draweth after it ſuch a Neceſſitation or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of mans will to good or evil, and we will preſently renounce it. But when he cannot do this, to bring reaſons and Fathers againſt the Coaction or Neceſſitation of mans will in actions good or evil, is pains taken to no purpoſe, as being a thing which no man defendeth. Let this brief replie therefore ſerve to this long diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To his firſt reaſon. When he hath proved that men reprobated ſinne as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily as <hi>Lions prey, birds flie,</hi> &amp;c. and that men abſolutely predeſtinated perform their holy and juſt actions by the ſame neceſſitie, let him explode abſolute Predeſtination and Reprobation, and ſet-up inſtead thereof the Remonſtrants conditionate Predeſtination and Reprobation upon foreſight of mens oppoſite acts good or bad, and we will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſubſcribe to his opinion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To his ſecond we anſwer, That ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Predeſtination and Reprobation do no more <hi>take away the conſcience of ſinne</hi> then that conditionate Predeſtination and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation which anciently the Semipelagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and of late the Remonſtrants found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſcience of mens holy or wicked acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For as the eternall Preſcience of God
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:135677:102"/> putteth no neceſſitation upon actions fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen, no more doth the eternall Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God. Gods decrees are immanent in himſelf after one manner, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall effects or events decreed are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by men after another, that is, contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and freely according to the nature of the agents. They themſelves feel and find this by their own experience in all predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated events, and therefore Gods eternall and ſecret decrees cannot nor do not take away the conſcience of mens ſinnes.

To his third reaſon there needeth no anſwer: It is in effect the ſame with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſtandeth upon this <hi>petitio principii,</hi> That all effects and events predeſtinated are fatall, and that the Agents have no libertie or choice in doing them: which is a groſſe errour, and rejected by School-divines and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:135677:102"/> by modern Papiſts as well as Proteſtants. His further amplifications are all to the ſame purpoſe, and therefore we let them paſſe.</p>
                  <p>What Auguſtine writeth for rectifying <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the judgement of the <hi>Adrumetine Monks,</hi> this Authour might have done well to have made uſe of for rectifying his own erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous judgement. They ſuppoſed that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Predeſtination could not ſtand together with mans freedome unto actions predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated; but Auguſtine taught them the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and ſo reclaimed them. And we wiſh that this Authour would out of S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine learn that his ſuppoſition is falſe and erroneous as theirs was.</p>
                  <p>For the Fathers which he bringeth to prove that it is injuſtice to puniſh men for acts to which they are neceſſitated and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by Gods Predeſtination and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, we ſubſcribe unto their judgement, and we retort it againſt this Authour thus: Auguſtine, Proſper, Fulgentius, Bernard, and others named by him, were defenders of abſolute Election and Non-election, and yet they held that men elected were juſtly rewarded for their good acts, and men paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed-by juſtly puniſhed for their bad acts; and therefore they ſuppoſed not Coaction or Neceſſitation to follow upon Election and Reprobation.</p>
                  <p>The concluſion, that men in their own
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:135677:103"/> actions <hi>do no more then would be done without them by the neceſsitating decrees of God;</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together falſe and vain. For Gods decrees are not neceſſitating, though the events de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed are infallible; and they leave the wills of men to as much libertie as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Preſcience doth. And this is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall opinion of Divines, though they differ about the manner of according mans liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with Gods Predeſtination.</p>

               <p n="2">2. The perſons in vvhoſe deſtruction God delighteth not; <hi>Wicked</hi> men, ſuch as for their rejecting of grace die and are damned. If God have no pleaſure in their death, much leſſe in the death of men either altogether innocent or tainted onely vvith originall ſinne.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The truth of his affection; <hi>As I live. Cupit crediſibì,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Novv if God delight not in the deſtruction of vvicked men, certainly he never did out of his abſolute pleaſure ſeal up ſo many millions of men lying in the fall under invincible damnation: For ſuch a decreeing of men to eternall death is directly oppoſite to a delight in their repentance and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</p>

               </p>
               <p>In theſe the Apoſtles vvords are tvvo ALLs of equall extent, the one ſtanding againſt the other; An ALL of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, and an ALL of objects of mercie.

               <p>
                  <hi>God ſo loved (E) the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John.</hi> 3 16.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>God loved the world,</hi> ſaith the Text, that is, the vvhole lump of mankind: therefore he did not abſolutely hate the greateſt part of men. Again, God loved it fallen into a gulf of ſinne and miſerie: For he ſo loved them as to ſend his Sonne to redeem them; and a Saviour preſuppoſeth ſinne. He did not therefore hate the moſt of them lying in the fall:
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:135677:104"/> for love and hatred are contrary acts in God, and cannot be exerciſed about the ſame objects.</p>
               <p>Many expoſitours (I knovv) do take <hi>World</hi> here in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained ſenſe, and underſtand by it the company of the Elect, or the vvorld of Believers onely: But they have little reaſon for it, in my opinion. For,</p>
               <p>Firſt, I think there can be no place of Scripture alledged vvherein this vvord <hi>World,</hi> eſpecially vvith the addition of <hi>whole,</hi> as 1. Epiſt. of John chap. 2. verſ. 2. (a place equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to this for the matter of it, and a comment upon it:) I ſay no place (I think) can be produced vvhere <hi>world</hi> doth ſignifie onely the Elect, or onely Believers: but it ſignifieth either all men, or at leaſt the moſt men living in ſome certain place and at ſome certain time, but vvithout diſtinction of good and bad. Or if it be uſed anyvvhere more reſtrainedly, it is applyed onely to vvicked and reprobate men, vvho in their affections are vvedded to the world and its tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitorie delights; and therefore do moſt properly deſerve this name.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Suppoſe it be granted, that <hi>World</hi> in ſome Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures is reſtrained to the Elect; yet it cannot bear this ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication here: Becauſe</p>
               <p n="1">1. The vvords then would have a ſenſeleſſe conſtruction: For thus vvould they runne, <hi>God ſo loved the elect,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh,</hi> &amp;c. And if they runne thus, this vvould follovv; There are tvvo ſorts of the Elect, ſome that do believe and ſhall be ſaved, others that do not believe and ſhall be damned: which is a diviſion or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction unknovvn in Divinitie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Believers and Unbelievers, Damned and Saved, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all mankind: for there is no man but he is one of theſe.

               </p>
               <p>In theſe vvords the Apoſtle delivereth tvvo things: 1. That it is Gods vvill that men ſhould enjoy a happy end, and be ſaved; 2. That it is alſo his vvill they ſhould have the means, and make a good uſe of them in coming to the knovvledge of the truth, that ſo they might be ſaved. There
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:135677:104"/> is no let in God, but that all men may believe and be ſaved; and therefore there is no abſolute will that many thouſand men ſhall die in unbelief and be damned.</p>
               <p>Tvvo anſvvers are uſually returned, vvhich I confeſſe give me little ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That by ALL here vve are to underſtand all ſorts, and not every particular man in thoſe ſorts.</p>
               <p>It is true, that ALL is ſometimes ſo taken in Scripture; but (I believe) not here: For the very context ſhevveth that vve are to underſtand by it the individualls, and not the kinds. In the firſt verſe there is a duty enjoyned; <hi>I will that prayers and ſupplications be made for all men:</hi> and in this verſe the motive is annexed, <hi>God will have all to be ſaved:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Our charitie muſt reach to all vvhom God extendeth his love to. God out of his love vvill have all to be ſaved; and therefore in charitie vve muſt pray for all. Novv in the duty ALL ſignifieth every man: for no man, though vvicked and profane, is to be excluded from our prayers. <hi>Pray for them,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>that perſecute you,</hi> and, <hi>Pray,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle here, <hi>for kings and all that are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority;</hi> men in thoſe dayes, though the greateſt, yet the worſt, the very Lions, Wolves and Bears of the Church: <hi>Pray for them.</hi> And if for them, then for any other. Thus in the duty it ſignifieth every man: and therefore it muſt have the ſame extent in the motive too, or elſe the motive doth not reach home, nor is ſtrong enough to enforce the dutie.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond <hi>(G)</hi> anſvver is, That God vvill have all to be ſaved vvith his <hi>revealed</hi> will, but millions to be damned vvith his <hi>ſecret</hi> vvill;</p>
               <p>But if this anſvver ſtand, then (in my apprehenſion) theſe inconveniences vvill follovv. 1. That Gods vvords (vvhich are his revealed vvill) are not interpretations of his mind and meaning; and by conſequence are not true: for the ſpeech vvhich is not the ſignification of the mind, is a lie. 2. That there are tvvo contrary vvills in God, a ſecret vvill, That many ſonnes of Adam ſhall irrevocably be damned; and a revealed vvill, That all the ſonnes of Adam may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. 3. That one of Gods vvills muſt needs be bad, either the ſecret or the revealed vvill. For of contraries, if the one be good, the other is bad: and ſo of Gods contrary vvills, if one be good, the other muſt needs be bad. For <hi>malum est contrarium bono.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.9.</note>
                  <hi>Not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This Scripture is not ſo liable to the exceptions againſt the former teſtimony. For it is a negative propoſition, and muſt be taken diſtributively: and therefore ſpeaketh that in plain terms which is contrary to abſolute Reprobation.</p>
               <p>That vvhich is uſually replyed, is, That the perſons here ſpoken of, are the elect onely and ſuch as truly believe; God is not willing that any of them ſhould periſh.</p>
               <p>But the contrary appeareth in the text. For the perſons here mentioned are thoſe tovvard whom God exerciſeth <hi>much patience</hi> and <hi>long-ſuffering,</hi> as it is in the vvords next going before. And vvho are they? Are they the elect? are they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers onely? No, but reprobates rather, vvho die for their contempt of grace. For it is apparent by Scriptures, that God doth patiently expect the converſion even of them that are never changed but die in their ſinnes: as vve may ſee 1. Pet. 3.19, 20, vvhere vve reade that the <hi>patience</hi> of God was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed tovvards thoſe who in the dayes of Noah deſpiſed it, and vvent to priſon, that is to hell, for it. Yea of all men reprobates are the trueſt and moſt proper objects of Gods patience, as we may ſee Rom. 2.4. where S. Paul ſpeaking of ſuch as go on in ſinne, and <hi>treaſure up wrath to themſelves against the day of wrath,</hi> ſaith, that God uſeth <hi>patience</hi> tovvards them <hi>that he might lead them to repentance.</hi> And Rom. 9.22. <hi>He endureth,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>with much long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction.</hi> In the fifth of Iſaiah v. 2. and the 65. chap. v. 2. we may ſee the ſame thing. Reprobates therefore as well as others, nay rather then others, doth Peter here ſpeak of, and ſaith that God would have none of them to periſh: If they do periſh, it is through their own fault and folly, and not Gods abſolute pleaſure, who would have no man to periſh.</p>

               <p>By all theſe and many other places that ſpeak conditionally (for ought that I can ſee) it is clear, that <hi>(K)</hi> God forſaketh no man conſidered ſimply in the fall, till by actuall ſinnes and continuance in them he forſake God. Now if God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject no man from ſalvation in time and in deed till he caſt off God, then ſurely he rejecteth no man in purpoſe and decree, but ſuch a one as he foreſaw would reject and caſt off him. For Gods acts in time are regulated by his decrees before time: Epheſ. 1.11. <hi>He worketh all things,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>according to the counſel of his own will:</hi> and therefore there muſt be an exact conformitie between them as between <hi>regulam</hi> and <hi>regulatum,</hi> the rule and the thing ſquared thereby. By whatſoever therefore God doth in the vvorld, we may know what he purpoſed to do before the world: and by his actuall caſting men off when they grow rebellious and impenitent, and not before, we may certainly gather that he decreed to caſt them off for their foreſeen rebellion and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, and not before.</p>
               <p>Beſides, it is in ſubſtance all one, to caſt a man off indeed and to entertein a reſolution to do it. Our <hi>velle</hi> and <hi>facere</hi> are all one in Gods account: and the reaſon is, Becauſe vvhere there is a deliberate and ſettled will, the deed will follow if nothing hinder. Much more is Gods will and deed all one, ſeeing his will is omnipotent and irreſiſtible, and whatſoever he willeth directly and abſolutely, is certainly done when the time cometh.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, this Authour ſhould have conſidered that there is no <hi>medium aſsigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile ex parte Dei</hi> betwixt the decrees of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinating ſome men and Not-predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome others; nor <hi>ex parte hominum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt men abſolutely predeſtinated unto the atteinment of life eternall and abſolutely pretermitted and left infallibly <hi>deficere ab ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eptione vitae aeternae,</hi> which we call abſolute Reprobation. As for example, let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the number of mankind to be two millions of men: If out of theſe by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of election one million onely be infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly appointed or ordained to eternall life, and theſe certainly and abſolutely diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from others not onely <hi>quoad nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> but <hi>quoad perſonas,</hi> who can denie but one million alſo, and thoſe certain <hi>quoad perſonas,</hi> are as abſolutely compriſed under the decree of Non-election or Reprobation as the others were under the decree of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or Predeſtination?</p>
                  <p>It is true that the manner of Gods bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the elect in time unto eternall life is by
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:135677:107"/> giving them repentance, faith and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and the manner of Gods permitting the Non-elect to run themſelves upon the rock of eternall death, is by ſuffering them to continue in their infidelitie and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie. But the formall decree of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation conteineth an abſolute eternall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of this effectuall grace for ſome; and the formall decree of negative Reprobation or Non-predeſtination an abſolute eternall decree of not-preparing this effectuall grace for any others. From whence it is plain that the Divine previſion of finall perſeverance in the elect, and finall impenitency in the non-elect, doth not nor cannot go before the forenamed decrees, as the Remonſtrants imagine.

                  <p>VVHereas theſe five reaſons are bent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> generally againſt the Sublapſarian doctrine, he ſhould have done well expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have excepted the doctrine of Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine and all his followers of the Church of England, and many other Divines, who are Sublapſarians, and maintein the abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Predeſtination and Non-election or negative Reprobation, utterly rejecting the Remonſtrants doctrine, who make theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Predeſtination and Reprobation to follow upon the finall good or bad acts of men eternally foreſeen of God. If his five reaſons be intended againſt theſe, I ſee not how he can be excuſed from the oppoſing
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:135677:109"/> of the ſettled doctrine of our own Church. If they were intended onely againſt ſome particular Divines, either of forrein Churches or of our own, he ſhould have called this diſcourſe, <hi>A diſproving of their erroneous opinion who from the abſolute decree of Non-election or Reprobation inferre an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute prime decree of particular mens damnation.</hi> Amongſt which exorbitant Divines he ſheweth himſelf to be one of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Now to come to his teſtimonies of Scripture. The queſtion being, Whether Gods eternall decree whereby men ſtand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed <hi>in Electos &amp; Non-electos,</hi> or <hi>in Praedeſtinatos &amp; negativè Reprobatos,</hi> be an abſolute prime decree, or a ſubſequent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree built upon mens foreſeen goodneſſe and badneſſe, all ſuch teſtimonies as confound the judiciall decree of mans Damnation with the negative Reprobation, will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent: For though the former be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, yet the latter is reſpective unto mans ſinnes. Again, all ſuch places as prove God hath a will of ſaving all men under this condition <hi>If they believe and perſevere,</hi> and of Damning of no man but for his iniquitie or infidelitie, prove ſufficiently that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall bringing of men unto eternall life ſtandeth upon conditionate decrees; and ſo likewiſe the temporall adjudging of men
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:135677:109"/> unto eternall death: but they are of no force at all to prove that Election and Non-electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are conditionate decrees, or to diſprove an abſolute decree of negative Reprobation. Laſt of all, ſuch places as prove a generall love or a generall mercy extending to every ſingular man in the world, do not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the decree of abſolute Non-election; becauſe love and mercy may be ſhown even to the Non-elect. This in generall. Now in particular to every teſtimony al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged.</p>
                  <p>To the firſt out of Ezek. 33.11. and the 18.32. we anſwer, This Authour quite <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ad </seg>1</label> forgetteth the very queſtion in hand. When <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> we diſpute of that ſpeciall providence which is called Predeſtination, and which concerneth the bringing of ſome men unto eternall life, and the freeing of them from eternall death, we ſpeak of ſuch a will as (by the confeſſion of all Divines) ſtandeth not upon uncertain conditions, but is moſt infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible and immutable, and that not onely <hi>certitudine praeſcientiae Divinae</hi> but <hi>ordinis &amp; cauſalitatis,</hi> as the Schoolmen ſpeak. Now the will ſpoken of in the teſtimonies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged is that <hi>voluntas ſimplicis complacentiae,</hi> or <hi>voluntas conditionata,</hi> which in regard of the good intended and promiſed unto men dependeth upon the good behaviour of their own free-will for the obteining of life and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:135677:110"/> avoyding of death. Notwithſtanding, this will which extendeth unto all, it is the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will and decree, that in ſome men<note n="m" place="margin">Ruiz. De volunt. <hi>18.</hi> Sect. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Creata libertas poſsit impedire effectûs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutionem; Et hoc vult permittere Deus propter majora bona.</hi> So that this will of exempting Judas or Cain from eternall death under condition of <hi>Turning from their wicked wayes,</hi> and yet permitting them final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to run on in their wicked wayes, is ſo far from proving that they were not under any ſuch decree of Reprobation, as we maintein that it evidently demonſtrateth the truth thereof. It proveth ſtrongly that neither mans ſinne nor mans eternall death do fall <hi>ſub voluntate ſimplicis complacentiae:</hi> for then they ſhould be <hi>bona &amp; amabilia per ſe:</hi> But it proveth not but God may decree the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of ſome men finally to die in their ſinnes, and eternally to be puniſhed for their ſinnes: wherein we place the decree of Reprobation.</p>
                  <p>The inference or collection, That <hi>God delighteth not in the deſtruction of wicked men,</hi> we willingly grant. For he is onely ſaid to delight in that whereunto he hath a naturall inbred propenſion: But this putteth no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary obligation upon God by ſpeciall mercy to free all men from deſtruction, though he could moſt eaſily do it.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>ſealing up of many millions under

We utterly deny that Reprobation inferreth any ſuch dealing of God with men Not-elected.</p>
                  <p>And for the Scriptures alledged, or others of the ſame kind; they do not affirm a conditionate Election upon foreſeen faith and perſeverance, but they ſhew us<note n="n" place="margin">Calv. De aetern. Dei Praedeſt. p. <hi>706.</hi>

                  <p>But the Apoſtle expreſſely ſaith, That <hi>God hath ſhut up</hi> ALL <hi>under unbelief, that he might have mercy upon</hi> ALL. <hi>The two</hi> ALLS <hi>are of an equall extent. How many unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers there be, on ſo many God hath a will of ſhewing mercie.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles meaning is this; That God in his providence permitted both Jews and Gentiles to be intangled in the guilt of juſt damnation, that ſo whoſoever is ſaved might aſcribe his ſalvation not to any foreſeen merits or any good works of his own, but to the free mercie of God. So that every man being by nature ſinfull and incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, all men lie alike at his mercie, and he may have mercy upon whom he pleaſeth. The Apoſtle is ſo farre from affirming that God ſheweth this ſpeciall mercie unto all unbelievers which he ſheweth unto ſome, namely the Enlightning of their dark minds, and the Mollifying of their obdurate hearts, that he ſaith the quite con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And yet if this Authour plead for no more then a generall mercy, we will eaſily grant him, That all men are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:135677:111"/> in an eſtate needing mercy, or in a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie of obteining mercie, but have an actuall participation of many and great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from the hand of almightie God. But when from hence he ſuddenly concludeth, That <hi>there is no preciſe antecedent will of God of ſhutting up the moſt men from all poſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of obteining mercie,</hi> he hath forgot the queſtion. He ſhould have concluded, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no abſolute will of God mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully electing ſome to the infallible at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinment of grace and glory, and by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the ſame ſpeciall mercy leaving others through their own default infallibly to fall into finall ſinne and miſery. Till he conclude this he concludeth nothing againſt abſolute Reprobation or Non-election.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God ſo loved the world,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore he <label type="milestone">

                  </p>
                  <p>We grant the concluſion, and more then he asketh: For God did not <hi>abſolutely hate</hi> any one man in the world. Neither will we make advantage of that opinion defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many Schoolmen,<note n="r" place="margin">Aquin. contra Gent. <hi>1.96.</hi>

                     <hi>Non propriè ſed ſimilitudinariè dici Deum odire.</hi> But our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, That abſolute Reprobation, which is nothing elſe but Gods abſolute will of denying the ſpeciall benefit of infallible di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection unto eternall life, and permitting ſome men by their own defective free-will
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:135677:112"/> deſervedly to fall under the miſerie of eternall death, is not an argument of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred towards any man, but of a leſſe degree of love towards ſome men then towards others; which leſſe degree of love is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times expreſſed by the name of <hi>hatred.</hi> Thus God is ſaid to <hi>have loved Jacob and hated Eſau,</hi> and that <hi>before they were born, or had done either good or evil.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe men have too high an opinion of the ſtrength of mans free-will that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, if God will be pleaſed not to hinder them, they will upon ſuch grace as is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed believe, and ſo attein eternall life.

                  <p>For the two Anſwers oppoſed by this Authour we need not much trouble our ſelves. If we underſtood the place <hi>de vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntate efficaci &amp; infallibiliter producente effectum volitum,</hi> as many do, we would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

                  <p>For the ſecond Anſwer which he taketh upon him to confute, namely of the <hi>reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and <hi>ſecret</hi> will of God; he ſhould firſt have rightly ſet it down, and then have try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſtrength in confuting it.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:135677:117"/> For example; It is an abſolute decree of the Divine will publiſhed in the Goſpel, <hi>That whoſoever repenteth, believeth, perſevereth, ſhall be ſaved:</hi> From hence is derived that mixt conditionall decree, <hi>If Cain, if Judas, if any other repent and believe, they ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Now ſuch mixt conditionall decrees carry no contradiction to the abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Election and Non-election or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. For who ſeeth not that theſe two propoſitions may well ſtand together, <hi>I will that if Judas repent and believe he ſhall have remiſsion and ſalvation; I will not give unto Judas the gift of repentance, of faith, and of eternall life?</hi> The former conditionall propoſition conteineth all which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour can truly collect from the teſtimonies alledged; and the latter doth as truly inferre that abſolute Reprobation for which we contend.

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:135677:118"/> Deſertion or Damnation is one thing; and Non-election or negative reprobation, another. Temporall forſaking is a with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of grace or favour formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon a man in regard of his ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and other ſinnes. And here we aſſent unto Auguſtine &amp; Proſper, the ſtrong main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teiners of Abſolute Predeſtination and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of Conditionate; <hi>Deus non deſerit niſi deſertus.</hi> Temporall rejecting from ſalvation is an adjudging of men unto damnation as being liable thereunto for their own ſinnes and miſdeſerts.

Theſe decrees be they which we deny to be founded upon any different foreſeen acts of men: and therefore we referre them to the abſolute will of God.

                  <p>Whereas this Authour further replyeth, <hi>That Gods acts in time are regulated by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees before time; and therefore by what God doeth in the world we may know what he purpoſed to do before the world:</hi> But he <hi>actually caſteth no man off till he grow rebellious and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; therefore he decreed to caſt no man off before his foreſeen rebellion and impenitency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This reply runneth upon the ſelf-ſame er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour with the former, namely the confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the decrees of eternall Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Preterition with the decrees of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Deſertion and Damnation, which are founded upon diſtinct cauſes, and ought to be diſtinguiſhed. But let us retort his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt himſelf. <hi>By what God doeth or not doeth in time we may know what he abſolutely purpoſed to do before all time: but God in time gave to Peter repentance faith, and eternall life; and God in time permitted Judas to die in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and impenitency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to incurre eternall death: Therefore he decreed before all time to give Peter all thoſe benefits, and he decreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all time to permit Judas to die in unbelief, impenitencie, and in an eſtate liable to damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Grant this, and abſolute Predeſtination is clearly granted. For as it were ſenſeleſſe to ſay Gods decree of giving faith and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance unto Peter was ſuſpended upon Peters foreſeen faith and perſeverance, ſo as ſenſeleſſe it is to ſay the decree of permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:135677:119"/> Judas to die in unbelief and finall impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency was grounded upon his foreſeen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief and finall impenitency.</p>
                  <p>We may now conclude, That abſolute Election and Non-election is ſurely found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the authority of many and manifeſt places of Scripture; but for conditionall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Preterition, it hath neither many nor any, clear nor obſcure.</p>

                  </note>SEcondly, it croſſeth <hi>(A)</hi> ſome principall Attributes of God: therefore it cannot be true. For God uſeth not to make decrees contrary to his own moſt glorious nature, and ſuch as are incompatible with thoſe excellent Attributes by which he hath diſcovered part of himſelf to men. <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas Dei ſemper ſequitur naturam ſuam,</hi> is a rule among Divines, <hi>Gods will alwayes followeth his nature.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why, is given by the Apoſtle, 2. Tim. 2.13. <hi>God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Two things are here to be premiſed:</p>
               <p n="1">I. That Gods chief <hi>(B)</hi> attributes are thoſe perfections in the manifeſtation of which by acts conformable to them God is moſt glorified: which are Mercy, Juſtice, Truth, and Holineſſe. For God is more honoured by the exerciſe of theſe among men then by the putting forth of his unlimited Power and Sovereignty; as a King is more renowned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his ſubjects for his equity, candour and clemency, then for his dominion and authority, or any thing that is done onely for the manifeſtation thereof. And there is good reaſon for it. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Power is no virtue; but Holineſſe, Mercy, Juſtice, and Truth are. Acts of Power are not morally good in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but are made good or evil by their concomitants. If they be accompanied with Juſtice, Mercy, &amp;c. they are good; if otherwiſe, they are naught. For <hi>justum oportet eſſe, quod laudem meretur;</hi> Nothing deſerveth praiſe, unleſſe it be juſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Power and Sovereignty may as well be ſhewed in bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and unjuſt actions as in their contraries. Saul ſhewed his Authority and Power to the full in ſlaying the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:135677:119"/> Lords Prieſts; and Nebuchadnezzar in caſting the three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into the fiery furnace, and Daniel into the lions den; but no Mercy, nor Juſtice, nor any thing elſe that was good.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The ſecond thing <hi>(C)</hi> to be preconſidered, is, That Juſtice, Mercy, Truth, and Holineſſe in God are the ſame in nature with theſe virtues in men, though infinitely differing in degree; (as light in the aire and the ſunne are the ſame in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not degree:) and that which is juſt, upright and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull in men, is ſo in God too: And by theſe virtues in our ſelves with acts conformable to them, <hi>tanquam ex pede Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culem,</hi> we may ſafely meaſure what are ſo in God. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe theſe things will follow;</p>
               <p n="1">1. The common and received diſtinction of Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes into <hi>communicable</hi> and <hi>incommunicable</hi> would fall to the ground. For againſt it this might be ſaid, That the Holineſſe, Mercy, Juſtice, and Sincerity, with other virtues that are in us, are not the perfections of God in a lower degree communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us, but things of a different nature.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Men cannot be truly ſaid to be<note n="a" place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27.</note> 
                  <hi>made according to Gods image;</hi> nor when they are regenerated to be<note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>made partakers of the Divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> That picture cannot be the picture of ſuch a man, which doth not in his parts and lineaments truly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him: no more can we be truly called the picture or image of God, if in our graces (in reſpect of which we are principally ſo called) there be not a lively reſemblance of Gods attributes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We may not ſafely imitate God, as we are commanded,<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.48</note>

                  <hi>Be ye holy, as I am holy.</hi> Nor when we ſhew forth holineſſe, mercy, juſtice and ſincerity in our doings, can we be properly ſaid to imitate God, if theſe be one thing in God and in men another.</p>
               <p>Theſe two things being thus premiſed, <hi>viz</hi> That Gods Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, Mercy, Juſtice and Truth are foure of his chief attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, in the exerciſe of which he taketh himſelf to be much glorified; and, That we are to meaſure theſe attributes by the ſame virtues in our ſelves: I come to the proof of my ſecond reaſon againſt abſolute Reprobation ſtated even in the mildeſt and moſt plauſible way.</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> The ſecond thing preconſidered is more doubtfull. For that may be unjuſt in men which is not unjuſt in God. As in a King it is an unjuſt action to ſet up Judges and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates over the people whom he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth will unjuſtly oppreſſe them: it is not ſo in God. In a Man it is want of mercy not to hinder a deſperate wretch from deſtroying
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:135677:120"/> himſelf when eaſily he might do it: Not ſo in God. Under the name of <hi>Virtues,</hi> when we aſcribe them to God, a permanent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion or inclination unto good actions conformable to the perfection of the Divine nature muſt be underſtood. I ſay a propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>in actu primo.</hi> For if God had never wrought any outward work of mercy or ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, he had notwithſtanding been as virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as now he is.

                  <p>We may ſafely affirm that there is an ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logicall <hi>conformity</hi> betwixt Divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane virtues: but that there is an identity of nature, is not ſo eaſily to be proved. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi> of men reſemble thoſe whoſe pictures they are: but they are not the ſame in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with them. We may and muſt <hi>imitate</hi> God in the actions of ſuch virtues as he hath commanded: but from hence it will not follow that the word <hi>virtue</hi> applyed to God ſignifieth the ſelf-ſame thing which it doth when it is applyed to men. But to come to particulars: we will not contend about words. Let this Authour onely look to it that he take his meaſure right, which muſt be <hi>reſecatis omnibus omnium virtutum partibus quae involvunt imperfectionem infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritatis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <hi>The fault of our nature cometh from Gods free appointment: for he doth not out of any neceſsitie, but of his mere will onely impute the ſinne of Adam to us.</hi> To this purpoſe he ſpeaketh a great deal more in the ſame place.

                  <hi>Adams ſinne is anothers, becauſe we knew not of it; and yet ours, becauſe it was through the just though ſecret judgement of God reputed ours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this that they ſay is agreeable to reaſon. For if vve be fallen into the guilt of the firſt ſinne and the corruption of nature, onely becauſe vve vvere in Adams loyns vvhen he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and derive our being from him, then theſe two things vvill follovv.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That vve <hi>(D)</hi> ſtand guilty of all the ſinnes vvhich A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam committed from his fall to his lives end. For vve vvere virtually in his loyns as vvell after his fall as before, and in every paſſage and variation of his life he vvas ſtill a principle of mankind. But vvhere do vve reade that vve are guilty of any other of his ſinnes? To the firſt ſinne onely doth the Scripture entitle that ſinne and miſery vvhich entred into the vvorld and invaded all mankind, as vve may ſee Rom. 5.15, 16, 17, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That children (E) are guilty of the ſinnes of all their progenitours, eſpecially of their immediate parents: For they vvere in their loyns vvhen they ſinned, and more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then in Adams. But children are not guilty of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents faults, nor obnoxious to their puniſhments, becauſe they are their children, as vve may ſee Exod. 20.5. vvhere God ſaying that he vvill <hi>viſit the ſinnes of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation in them that hate him,</hi> plainly implyeth, that children are not ſimply char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vvith their fathers ſinnes, but conditionally if they be <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of God as their fathers were; if by imitating their vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked parents they become partakers of their ſinnes. In Ezek. 18.14. &amp;c. The Lord ſignifieth thus much in his apologie againſt the cavill of the Jevvs. For firſt he ſaith, That if a vvicked man beget a ſonne that ſeeth his fathers ſinnes, and doth not the like, he ſhall not die for the iniquity of his father. This implyeth that the derivation of being from the parent doth not render the child obnoxious to the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:135677:122"/> of the fathers ſinne, nor conſequently to the ſinne. For the good child is not obnoxious, and yet the good child is equally in the fathers loyns with the bad, and equally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth nature and being from him. And then <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. the Lord telleth them expreſſely thus much in tvvo propoſitions: 1. Affirmatively, <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall die.</hi> And that it may be known that he ſpeaketh excluſively, Onely the ſoul that ſinneth, ſhall die, he delivereth his mind 2. Negatively, <hi>The ſonne ſhall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither ſhall the father bear the iniquity of the ſonne,</hi> &amp;c. Our Saviour in that wofull ſpeech of his to the Phariſees, Matth. 23.32, 34. <hi>Fulfill ye alſo the meaſure of your fathers. — Behold I ſend unto you Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>them ye ſhall kill and crucifie, that on you may come all the righteous bloud,</hi> &amp;c. intimateth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently, that the Phariſees vvere not inheritours of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſinnes and puniſhments by birth; but by the commiſſion and imitation of their fathers ſinnes, they came to inherit both their ſinnes and plagues. Miſerable vvould our caſe be on vvhom the ends of the vvorld are come, if children ſhould be guilty of all their anceſtours prevarications. What a vvorld of ſinnes ſhould vve be to anſwer for, Perſonall ſinnes, Parents, Progenitours ſinnes, to a thouſand paſt generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? A thing vvith no reaſon to be imagined. This is the firſt thing.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Secondly, they ſay <hi>(F)</hi> that God had immutably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to leave the farre greateſt part of mankind in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent condition irrecoverably, and to afford them no povver and ability ſufficient to make them riſe out of ſinne to nevv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of life: and this decree he executeth in time: and both theſe he doth out of his onely vvill and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Of this propoſition there be three branches:</p>
               <p n="1">1. God decreeth to leave them. 2. He doth leave them. 3. He doth both out of his alone pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God (ſay they) hath <hi>(G)</hi> decreed to leave them vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſufficient grace, and conſequently under an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neceſſitie of ſinning. This is the very Helen vvhich they fight for, the main act of that abſolute Reprobation vvhich with joynt conſent and endeavour they labour to maintein.</p>
               <p>Moſt of them caſt their Reprobation into two acts: a <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</hi> which is a peremptory deniall of grace and glory to ſome men lying in the fall; and a <hi>Poſitive,</hi> which they ſay is a preordination of men thus left to the eternall torments of hell.

But he did not repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate all: Therefore for ſinne he reprobated none, but for his own pleaſure, in which we muſt reſt without ſeeking any other cauſe.</p>
               <p>Now from theſe two things laid together, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That God did bring <hi>(O)</hi> men into a neceſſitie of ſinning; 2. That he hath left the reprobates under this neceſſitie: it will follow that he is the authour of the reprobates ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>Cauſa cauſae eſt cauſa cauſati,</hi> The cauſe of a cauſe is the cauſe of its effect, (if there be a neceſſary ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation between the cauſes and the effect;) whether it be a cauſe by acts negative or poſitive: But God is the chief or ſole cauſe (by their doctrine) of that which is the neceſſary and immediate cauſe of the ſinnes of Reprobates, namely their
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:135677:123"/> impotencie and want of ſupernaturall grace: Therefore he is (by the ſame doctrine) the true and proper cauſe of their ſinnes.</p>

               <p>It will not ſuffice to ſay, that God by withholding grace from Reprobates becometh onely an <hi>accidentall</hi> not <hi>(Q)</hi> a proper and direct cauſe of their ſinnes.

But when the effect is looked for and aimed at, then the cauſe (though it be the cauſe onely by withholding the impediment) is not acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; as a Pilote who withholdeth his care and skill from a ſhip in a ſtorm, foreſeeing that by his neglect the ſhip will be drowned, is not to be reputed an accidentall but a direct and proper cauſe of the loſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>Whether Abſolute Reprobation fight with Gods Holineſſe.</head>
                  <p>THe abſolute Reprobation which we maintein is nothing elſe but an abſolute purpoſe in God of not-beſtowing grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly bringing unto glory upon ſome men, which he hath abſolutely purpoſed to beſtow upon others. And this we evidently ground upon the Doctrine of our Church, which acknowledgeth Predeſtination to be a ſpeciall favour or benefit extended to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> certain number known onely to God, from whence faith, perſeverance and eternall life do flow as effects from the cauſe. And becauſe the affirmation ferveth to meaſure the negation, our Church ſpeaking in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle nothing at all of Non-election or Non-predeſtination, leaveth it obvious to every mans underſtanding that all not compriſed within the number of the elect muſt needs fall within the number of the non-elect, as being permitted <hi>deficere à gratia &amp; gloria</hi> by their own default. And further, our Church in adding, <hi>Notwithſtanding the decree of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination and Election Gods generall promiſes must be received as they are propounded in the Goſpel,</hi> intimateth, That the decrees of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction &amp; Non-election or Reprobation may ſtand firm <hi>cum poſsibilitate ad eventus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarios</hi> though not <hi>cum eventis contrariis.</hi> For
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:135677:124"/> Peter notwithſtanding his Predeſtination might have been damned if he had volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily continued in his impenitency, and Judas notwithſtanding his Reprobation might have been ſaved if he had not voluntarily continued in his impenitency. The abſolute decrees of Election and Non-election are not contradictory to the generall condition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all promiſes of ſalvation or threats of da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnation. As therefore we condemne the opinion of the Remonſtrants, who by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Election and negative Reprobation unto foreſeen good and bad acts of men erre upon the one hand, ſo we condemne alſo their opinions who confound the decree of Damnation with this of Non-election, or who derive the cauſes of damnation, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinne, infidelity, impenitency, from the fore-named decree; which is to erre further upon the other hand. Theſe things premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed we will now go along with this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour, and ſee how he proveth this abſolute Reprobation or Non-election which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend to oppoſe any of Gods principall At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith <hi>it ſighteth with his holineſſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>it maketh him the principall cauſe of ſinne</hi> in all perſons not-elected or not-predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

                  <p>As for the Synod of Dort, it conſidered not Predeſtination and Reprobation <hi>in maſſa

For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it before or after the decree is alike fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, if immutability of events decreed by God be termed fatality. And put it before or after, it neither way maketh God the principall cauſe of ſinne: which is clear in non-elect angels, in whom Reprobation conſidered before the fall is by no judicious Divine conceived to make God the cauſe of their ſinne.</p>
                  <p>But he goeth about to prove that abſolute <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Reprobation maketh God the Authour of ſinne, becauſe ſome defenders thereof <hi>ſay two things</hi> from whence (he thinketh) it may be inferred That God is the principall cauſe of ſinne.

As if he that holdeth two falſe propoſitions, might not for all that hold a third which is true.</p>
                  <p>His firſt Propoſition wherewith he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the defenders of abſolute Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is, <hi>That God of his own will and pleaſure hath brought men into an eſtate in which they cannot avoid ſinne, namely, into the eſtate of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne,</hi> and that both in regard of the <hi>guilt</hi> and of the <hi>corruption.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is both odiouſly and falſely ſet down. No man holdeth that God brought Adams
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:135677:126"/> poſterity either into the eſtate of their guilt or of their corruption: but all maintein that it was Adam himſelf who by his voluntary prevarication inwrapped himſelf and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity both in the guilt and contagion of originall ſin.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>Twiſse,</hi> I will quote him ſome Authours. And firſt to begin with the Maſter of the ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; He teacheth that not God but Adam

<pb n="247" facs="tcp:135677:127"/> falſe conſequent to a true antecedent. For though Gods will was the cauſe of making the former decree, That all Adams poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould be liable to the loſſe of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and puniſhment of ſinne upon Adams diſobedience, even as if themſelves had ſingularly and perſonally tranſgreſſed; yet neither God nor this decree of God was the cauſe either of Adams tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion perſonally committed by himſelf, or of the corruption and guilt of damnation which ſeiſed upon his poſteritie. The law or decree, That if a noble man become a traitour, he with all his poſteritie ſhall be tainted in bloud, and ſtripped of the priviledges of nobilitie, is not the cauſe either of the fathers treaſon or of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens loſſe and puniſhment: but the true proper working cauſe thereof is the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious will and act of the father. Even ſo here, Gods decree revealed unto Adam, That if he ſinned all his poſteritie ſhould be liable to corporall and ſpirituall death, was ſo farre from being the cauſe of his ſinne or his childrens miſerie, that it was in its own nature a ſtrong retractive or preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to have kept him and his children out of ſinne and out of miſerie.</p>
                  <p>If Adams diſobedience (which was the onely true cauſe of his own and childrens miſerie) had followed as a neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

Albeit therefore <hi>naturall generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> conſidered alone in it ſelf without the fore-named free conſtitution of God, would not have propagated Adams ſinne or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unto his poſteritie, yet we acknowledge (and ſo did Calvine) that it is now propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by way of naturall generation; becauſe God had enacted that Adam ſhould beget children in his own likeneſſe, that is parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the ſame originall righteouſneſſe which he had, ſuppoſing he kept it; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of his ſinne, ſuppoſing he infected himſelf with the act and guilt of ſinne.</p>

Again, they which maintein abſolute Reprobation will no more grant that it putteth or leaveth any man under everlaſting neceſſitie of ſinning, then that abſolute Predeſtination putteth men under a neceſſitie of not ſinning.

<pb n="259" facs="tcp:135677:133"/> ſay, That God doth in time according to his eternall decree withhold from all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Not-elected that ſpeciall mercie or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall grace which he knoweth would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly free them from finall ſinne and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, and leaveth them (not without all grace, nor under a neceſſitie of living and continuing in the practice of their ſinnes, but) under grace committed (as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants would have it) to the dominion and good uſage of their own free-will, and under a permiſſion of their finall ſinning and impenitency out of their own free-will: From both which God infallibly foreſaw their finall impenitencie, and reſpectively there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto decreed their eternall puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>But how doth he prove that they muſt needs ſay as he would have them? His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, Becauſe <hi>Gods decrees cannot be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated: What he purpoſed before time, without fail he doth in time.</hi> We agree that <hi>quoad eventum</hi> Gods decrees cannot be fruſtrated. But this impoſſibilitie of fruſtration ariſeth not from a neceſſitie put upon the agents to do thus and not otherwiſe (as this Authour perpetually but moſt falſely doth ſuppoſe) but from that infallible providence of God, who can and doth bring into act events de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed according to the nature of the next cauſes or immediate agents. Naturall agents work naturally in producing decreed events:
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:135677:134"/> neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary agents work neceſſarily: and free agents ſuch as are Angels and men, work freely. It is a flat <hi>Non-ſequitur,</hi> Events decreed cannot be fruſtrated; Therefore the agents are under a neceſſitie of ſinning. And it is further to be conſidered, that albeit all Gods decrees are infruſtrable, yet there is a main difference betwixt Gods decrees of producing good ſaving acts in his Elect, and of permitting the Non-elect to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce their wicked actions, and finally to continue in them. The former he doth by uſing his own hand in framing their hearts unto ſuch good actions, and guiding their wills indeclinably in the voluntary practice thereof: but as for the latter, their wicked hearts are not wrought by God, nor their wicked wills guided by God unto their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked actions, but they are permitted out of their own free-will to commit ſuch wicked actions. Here is no neceſſity put upon the agents by either of the forenamed decrees.</p>

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:135677:135"/> worth the obſerving, That when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants have ſaid all they can for the univerſalitie and ſufficiencie of ſaving grace, they are forced by convincing arguments and evidence of Scripture to retreat unto the ſame univerſalitie and conditionall ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie which I ſpake of but now, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in no man oppoſeth them.

Our Engliſh Divines affirm that this Non-election is founded in the moſt free plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God: So our Spaniſh Divines, our Italian Divines, French Divines (who never ſaw the Synod of Dort) and in a word, all Divines who know what they affirm when they diſpute of Non-election or negative Reprobation.

This is with Fauſtus the Semipelagian to make Predeſtination an act of remunerative juſtice, and to make Non-predeſtination or Non-election an act of vindicative juſtice: both which are rejected as erroneous not onely by Calviniſts or Contra-remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants, but even by the common conſent of the Romane Divines. God at the laſt day ſhall crown the Elect and condemne the Non-elect according to their finall perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in faith or infidelitie and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency. But this difference of their finall eſtates abſolutely foreſeen is a conſequent not an antecedent to the decrees of Election and Preterition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> I might paſſe-by what he further addeth upon his own falſe inferences, of Gods <hi>bringing men into a neceſsitie of ſinning,</hi> and <hi>leaving Reprobates under this neceſsitie,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have ſhewed no ſuch thing can be deduced from that abſolute negative Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation which we defend. But let us heare what he will ſay. He reaſoneth thus; CAUSA CAUSAE EST ETIAM CAUSA CAUSATI, <hi>where there is a neceſſary ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination betwixt the cauſe and the effect, whether it be a cauſe negative or poſitive: But by the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of abſolute Reprobation we make <hi>God the chief or ſole cauſe of the ſinnes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, namely through their impotency or
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:135677:137"/> want of ſupernaturall grace.</hi> For the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Axiome, we admit it <hi>ubi ſecunda cauſa non egreditur ordinem primae,</hi> that is, where the ſecond cauſe worketh or doeth any thing by virtue of that influx or motion that it hath from the firſt.</p>
                  <p>As for this diſtinction of <hi>Negative</hi> and <hi>Poſitive</hi> cauſing, it is obſcure and improper. The aire hath heat and light from the poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive cauſing of the ſunne-beams; darkneſſe, foggineſſe, coldneſſe followeth upon the negation of the ſunne-beams: and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſunne nor his beams nor the retra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his beams, are true or proper cauſes of coldneſſe or darkneſſe in the aire. The reaſon himſelf hath touched upon, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe diſpoſitions or qualities in the aire iſſue not from the ſunne <hi>per ſubordinatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem effecti ad cauſam,</hi> but out of the nature of the aire onely: That is a cauſe <hi>per quam res eſt id quod eſt.</hi> Thus the ſunne is the true cauſe that the aire is hot and light. If by virtue flowing from the abſent ſunne it be made dark, then might we call the ſunne a cauſe of the darkneſſe. In proportion we ſay the ſame of God: If from his decree of Non-election there flow any darkneſſe or pravity into mans will, or any crookedneſſe and ſinfulneſſe into his actions, there were ſome colour in terming him a negative cauſe of mans ſinne: But this he ſhall never be able to demonſtrate.</p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:135677:138"/>
                  <p>He ſaith, that <hi>God</hi> by his decree of nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Reprobation <hi>is the ſole or chief cauſe of that impotencie and want of ſupernaturall grace which is the neceſſarie and immediate cauſe of all the ſinnes which they commit.</hi> Want of the grace of Predeſtination is neither chief nor ſole, nor any cauſe at all of the ſinnes of the Non-predeſtinate. Non-Election or negative Reprobation doth not involve any ſuch impotencie of avoiding ſinfull acts, or any ſuch neceſſitie of committing ſinfull actions, as this man imagineth. For though Preterition or Non-election be not a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or beſtowing of ſuch grace as would infallibly make men better, yet it muſt not be conceived to be the working of any thing in them whereby they are made worſe. Again, though negative Reprobation be a deniall of ſuch grace as doth effectually produce the faith, perſeverance, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall happineſſe of the Elect, yet it is no ſuch abſolute ſubtraction of grace as is a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie and immediate cauſe of any mans parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſinnes, or of his finall perſeverance in ſinne. The Non-elect Angels were under the eternall decree of negative Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before they were created; yet were they not by want of ſufficient grace at their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made impotent to ſtand, much leſſe conſtrained by any neceſſitie to rebell and ſinne againſt God. Adam in the ſtate of
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:135677:138"/> his innocencie was not predeſtinated to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance; nay, (which is more) God had poſitively decreed the permiſſion of his fall: yet the want of a decree predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his perſeverance in that eſtate did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affect him with an impotencie of ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor with a neceſſitie of falling. <hi>Vide Proſp. ad Vincent.

God is ſaid even from the Non-elect <hi>exſpectare uvas non labruſcas,</hi> becauſe he affordeth them ordinary means for producing the one, but they themſelves by abuſe of the means are the onely cauſes producing the other.

               <p>But to deliver <hi>(I)</hi> things a little more cloſely; Foure things (in my conceit) being well and diſtinctly conſidered, do make it apparent that this decree is incompatible with Gods mercy. 1. That Adams ſinne is the ſinne of mans nature onely, and no mans perſonall tranſgreſſion, but Adams: It was neither committed nor conſented to by any of his poſterity in their own perſons. 2. That it was the ſinne of our nature, not by gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration (as I have ſhewed) but by Gods own voluntary impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. 3. That God did pardon it in Adam, (for ſo it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally believed) who did actually and freely commit it in his own perſon. 4. That Chriſt came into the world to take away <hi>peccatum mundi,</hi> the ſinne of the world, Joh. 1.29. That God either did or might have ſatisfied his wronged juſtice in the bloud of the Covenant for all mankind, and without any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment to juſtice have opened a way of ſalvation to all and every man. Theſe conſiderations (I think) being well dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, will make any man to think, that either there is no decree of <hi>(K)</hi> abſolute Reprobation, or that God is not mercifull to men at all, much leſſe more mercifull to them then to other creatures, but more ſharp a great deal and ſevere then he is to

                  <p>Secondly, though in God there be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent inclination or naturall diſpoſition to produce thoſe outward effects which in us proceed from habituall virtues, as To endow his creatures with many good things, which we term Bountie or Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; To help them out of their miſeries, which we term Mercie; To puniſh them according to their miſdeſerts, which we call Juſtice, and the like: yet God ſhould not have been covetous or niggardly, had he never diffuſed drop of his bountie to any creature, but kept and enjoyed his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

                  <p>Thirdly, it is to be obſerved, That how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever mercie and juſtice are by us conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as diſtinct virtues or operations in God, yet his remunerative juſtice ſhould never find a fit object, had he not by ſome benefit of free mercie and grace himſelf fitted it thereunto: And this is the benefit which we call abſolute Election or Predeſtination.

But let us ſee how he will prove that abſolute Reprobation cannot ſtand with the mercie of God.</p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:135677:145"/>
                  <p>His premiſes are theſe: <hi>God is ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull, that mercie is a part of his title.</hi> Gods mercie <hi>abſolutely is ſet forth in high and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terms,</hi> RICH, GREAT, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Gods Love and Mercie is his <hi>naturall work,</hi> his Juſtice <hi>a ſtrange work:</hi> He is more <hi>frequent in the exerciſe</hi> of his Mercie then Juſtice: He <hi>extendeth</hi> it to more <hi>objects,</hi> upon leſſe <hi>occaſions,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>All this granted will not inferre this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, Therefore Election and Non-ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction (or negative Reprobation) depend not upon Gods abſolute will, but upon the different foreſeen will and acts of men. What a vain labour is it to amplifie and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerate premiſes which are of no force to induce the concluſion intended, nay which for the moſt part are rather of force to overthrow it?

                  <p>
                     <hi>God is mercifull.</hi> True: but the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of his mercie is different, to ſome more, to ſome leſſe, according to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute purpoſe and counſel of his own will.

It is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a purpoſe of not beſtowing upon ſome perſons that choice mercie and effectuall grace which would infallibly bring them unto glorie, and a permiſſion of them by
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:135677:145"/> their own free-will to abuſe thoſe means of ſalvation which are afforded them. And hereupon followeth Gods abſolute preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their finall impenitencie, and his fore-appointment of them to their juſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. The Maſter of the Sentences ſpeaketh fitly to this purpoſe;<note n="f" place="margin">

                  <p>
                     <hi>God is Mercie in the abſtract, a Father of Mercies: His nature and propertie is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to have mercie and to forgive.</hi> Theſe and ſuch like places prove two things: Firſt, that acts of mercie flow unto us many times from Gods naturall boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, unpromiſed, undeſerved, undeſired on our parts. But we anſwer, that this
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:135677:146"/> prime mercie, which is not promiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on condition to any particular perſon, is at Gods own abſolute will for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing or withholding: and this we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort againſt the Remonſtrants. For the mercie which ſheweth it ſelf in Election being of this kind, it is an errour to make either the beſtowing or not-beſtowing it to depend upon conditions foreſeen or not foreſeen in men. Secondly, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures above alledged prove that God extendeth his mercie at all times and to all perſons indifferently according to the tenour of the promiſe: that is, He ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver faileth to forgive the penitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to beſtow the crown of eternall life upon the faithfull and conſtant belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. If he could have alledged any Scripture which had avouched that it is Gods nature and propertie to give repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, faith, perſeverance to all men, he had quite overthrown abſolute Election and Non-election: But ſince God, who could have prepared and beſtowed the gift of faith and perſeverance as well upon this man as upon that, and who accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ordination and promiſe hath bound himſelf to forgive and to ſave this man if he repent, if he believe, if he perſevere, as well as that, and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decreed to give nor giveth to this as to
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:135677:146"/> that, ſurely he hath elected ſome, and not-elected others, out of his own abſolute will and pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Gods mercy is <hi>ſet out in high and ſtately ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> RICH, GREAT, ABUNDANT, VVITH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUT DIMENSIONS, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of theſe places ſpeak of that rich and ſpeciall Mercy which God hath extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſome in their effectuall vocation, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, ſanctification, and which he will moſt certainly extend towards them in their glorification; as will appear to any man that ſhall particularly weigh them. From theſe places if I ſhould reaſon thus, <hi>God hath ſhewed</hi> GREAT, RICH, ABUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DANT <hi>mercy unto ſome, in chooſing them before the foundations of the world were laid, in effectually calling them, even when they were dead in ſinne, in freely ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying them, in mercifully glorifying them; and he hath not done thus for many others: Therefore Election and Non-election depend upon the abſolute will of God, and not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the foreſeen acts of men,</hi> this were a good concluſion: But to conclude, <hi>Therefore there is no decree of abſolute Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Non-election,</hi> it is not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſequent, but contrary to the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And yet further, if ſuch places of Scripture ſhould be applied to that <hi>rich</hi> mercy which God is ready to extend to
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:135677:147"/> every man who performeth the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of repenting, believing, perſevering, they make nothing againſt the decrees of abſolute Election and Preterition, unleſſe he can ſhew that God hath prepared the ſame riches of his mercy to make all men fulfill the conditions. For if this prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration be made for ſome and not for others, and that according to Gods abſolute will, and not according to the foreſeen diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of good and bad wills in men; this <hi>rich</hi> mercy of God which this Authour hath mentioned for the confuting of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Election and Non-election is rather a confirming thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Mercy is more <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> unto God: vindicative Juſtice is <hi>a ſtrange work. He doth not willingly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That is ſaid to be <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>pleaſing</hi> unto God, which cometh originally from himſelf, &amp; is not an act depending upon the miſdeſerts of the creature. But this <hi>naturalneſſe</hi> of Gods mercy and bounty doth not ſhew it ſelf in the outward effects thereof, as naturall agents do, who work according to the uttermoſt of their power, and as farre as the ſphere of their activitie can reach. Let bountie and mercy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be never ſo naturall to God, it forceth him not in the ſame meaſure and manner
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:135677:147"/> to extend the effects of his mercy unto all, but he alwayes guideth the diſpenſation thereof according to the abſolute and free decrees of his own will: So that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalneſſe of his mercy hindereth not the limiting of that ſpeciall mercy which flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from Election unto ſuch ſingular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as himſelf intendeth it unto; neither doth it forbid him to withhold the ſame from ſuch ſingular perſons as he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to paſſe-by in the diſpenſation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And this abſolute libertie and ſupreme dominion which God hath in the preparing or not-preparing of effectuall grace, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the abſolute decrees of Election &amp; Non-election do ſhew themſelves, is a thing as <hi>naturall</hi> and as <hi>pleaſing</hi> unto God as his Mercy.</p>
                  <p>As for vindicative Juſtice, it may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>ſtrange work,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>opus occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum</hi> by mans tranſgreſſion. But as Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination is no act of remunerative Juſtice, no more is negative Reprobation or Non-election of vindicative Juſtice: but they are both acts of Gods abſolute dominion and free libertie, in giving or withholding his own according to his own will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>God is more <hi>frequent</hi> and forward <hi>in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> exerciſe</hi> of his Mercy and Bounty then of his Anger and vindicative Juſtice.</p>
                  <pb n="288" facs="tcp:135677:148"/>
                  <p>A ſtrange argument, grounded upon a manifeſt errour, namely, That the abſolute decree of Non-election is the exerciſe of Gods anger and vindicative juſtice upon perſons not-elected. There were Angels elected and not-elected according to Gods decree, before the world or Angels were made: but there was no exerciſe of anger or vindicative juſtice upon them till after they had rebelled. Non-election is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute decree of withholding an undue fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, but it is no abſolute decree of inflicting any undeſerved puniſhment. Neither doth it follow from the abſolute decree of Non-election, that God is leſſe frequent in the acts of Mercy then of Anger. For though he have not exerciſed this ſpeciall act of Mercy, yet he exerciſeth daily innumerable acts of Mercy towards the Non-elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all deſert of theirs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 
                     <hi>In the amplitude of objects to whom it is extended</hi> Mercy ſurmounteth Juſtice. God <hi>viſiteth the third and fourth generation; ſheweth mercy to thouſands. His mercy reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as much further,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Shewing of mercy to thoſe which love God, and puniſhing thoſe which hate him, are the exerciſing of Gods remunerative and vindicative Juſtice according to his own ordination: But the preparing of that ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grace for ſome men which being given
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:135677:148"/> them cauſeth them to love God &amp; conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to walk with God; and the not-preparing the ſame for others is the act or decree of Election and Non-election. Now what a looſe and wild manner of reaſoning is this? <hi>Remunerative Juſtice reacheth further then vindicative; therefore there is no abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Non-election. Juſtice in the number of objects cometh ſhort of Mercy; therefore there is no abſolute decree of Non-election?</hi> Juſtice muſt needs come ſhort of mercy, becauſe (though not the ſpeciall mercy of Election, yet) mercy, yea manifold mercies are beſtowed upon every ſingular man in the world. So that the Elected by ſpeciall grace being freed from becoming objects of Gods vindicative Juſtice, and both Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Non-elected being objects of his Mercy in divers meaſures and after divers manners, we may grant a larger extent of Mercy then of vindicative Juſtice, and yet without all prejudice to abſolute Election and Not-election. For as long as God deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unjuſtly or cruelly with no man, his dealing more mercifully with Peter in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring effectuall grace for him by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Predeſtination, and leſſe mercifully with Judas in not preparing for him ſuch grace by an oppoſite decree of Preterition, is no deniall of the generalitie of his mercy, but an affirmation of more mercy to one

                  <p>This Authour (by his continuall manner of ſpeech) ſeemeth to attribute unto God ſuch a naturall affection towards men as is found in Fathers, Mothers, in Birds and brute Beaſts towards their young.

Thirdly, the naturall affection of love or pitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their young ones doth not in brute beaſts ſo equally determine their affection, but they inwardly may bear and outwardly may ſhew more affection and more effects of their affection to one then to another. And in men the naturall affection of love doth not ſo determine Fathers or Mothers, but it leaveth Jacob free to love Joſeph more then his brethren, and to give unto him more effects of his love then unto the reſt: It leaveth Rebecca free to love Jacob more then Eſau, and to do more for him then for Eſau. If the naturall affection in Beaſts towards their young ones excludeth not all difference of more and leſſe in their love; if the naturall love of Parents to their children be no hindrance but they may ſhew more effects of this love to one, and leſſe to another; then God, in whom Love or Mercy are effections and not affections, may freely both in naturall and ſupernaturall things do more for ſome, and leſſe for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The decree therefore of Non-ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:135677:150"/> or negative Reprobation, being not a decree which denieth all effects of Love or Pitie to the Non-elect, but a decree onely denying them that high and choice effect of infallible direction unto eternall life, this decree may well ſtand with the Mercy and Love of God.</p>

                     </label> that God in his decree of Reprobation deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the greater part of men after ſuch a cruel manner as is deſcribed. Secondly, that he doth this for no perſonall offenſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by themſelves. Thirdly, that he doth it for a ſinne or offenſe imputed onely unto them. Grant him all this, and then he conceiveth abſolute Reprobation cannot ſtand with the mercy of God. But all his three preſuppoſals are falſe. The decree of negative Reprobation is no <hi>determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of any man <hi>to cruel torments worſe then death,</hi> but an abſolute determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion immanent in the Divine will of not-beſtowing upon ſome angels and men that ſpeciall effectuall grace which would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly bring them to the incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble joyes of eternall life. And the judiciall decree of Damnation unto eternall torments is a diſtinct decree from this of negative Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and dependeth reſpectively upon the guilt of the partie preconſidered, who for it is juſtly to be puniſhed, as hath already

But the way which he opened for every one of us to partake the fruit of our redemption and of his plenary ſatisfaction, is by repentance and faith to come and lay hold of the Redeemer. The decrees of Election and Non-election are no obſtacles unto the doing of this, or excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt any man which ſhall do this, and therefore they may ſtand in their full force

                  </p>
                  <p>Admit not onely of abſolute Non-ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which (as hath been often ſaid) is neither any penaltie nor any miſery of the creature not elected, but let us further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that angels and men not elected or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatively reprobated do alwayes infallibly draw upon themſelves by their own default extreme and endleſſe miſery; yet it will not follow that God hath been leſſe mercifull unto ſuch perſons not elected (ſuppoſe Cain or Judas) then to the brute creatures. Firſt, becauſe in every perſon not elected there are innumerable effects of Gods mercy and goodneſſe whereof the other creatures are uncapable. Secondly, becauſe what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Gods goodneſſe or mercy are found in the other creatures, are mercies or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits rather beſtowed upon men for whoſe uſes they ſerve, then upon the creatures. Now theſe ſerving to the uſe of the Non-elect, as much and oftentimes more then of the Elect, the mercy or goodneſſe of God imparted to the creatures redoundeth more unto them. Suppoſe therefore the creatures are in a better condition of being then the Non-elect finally bring themſelves unto,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:135677:154"/> yet this good being of the creature is a mercy of God principally exhibited unto the men who have the uſe thereof. But this looſe manner of reaſoning cometh from the falſe conceit, That Non-election is the determining of perſons not-elected by an omnipotent decree to their wofull being: Whereas Non-election or negative Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is an eternall decree in the will of God of not doing that for the advancement of ſome men unto a ſupernaturall bleſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he hath freely and graciouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to do for others, and conteineth not any thruſting of them into a wofull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by an omnipotent operation, but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to fall into ſuch a wofull be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by their own voluntary default and tranſgreſſion.</p>
                  <p>As for his queſtions, <hi>What man would have accepted of life, if he had known upon what lamentable conditions it was to be tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? or</hi> who would not <hi>curſe the day of his birth,</hi> if he did firmly believe that there were any abſolute decree of Election and Non-election?</p>
                  <p>To the former I anſwer, That eternall Election and Preterition are no capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the creature, no conditions ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered unto the creature, but onely imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent abſolute reſolutions in the Creatour. And yet if God had revealed unto Cain
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:135677:154"/> or Judas the decree of his Preterition when they firſt entred upon poſſeſſion of this life, it had not been an act of right reaſon or an orderly will to have refuſed it with many other good things freely given unto them by God, for fear of a future bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which they might caſt themſelves into by their own voluntary wickedneſſe. If God had revealed his decree of Non-election to the angels which proved apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaticall, it had been folly and madneſſe to have refuſed that excellent being which God beſtowed upon them, for fear of that wofull being which by his permiſſion they brought wilfully upon themſelves. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God in his wisdome hath made the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Election and Non-election ſecrets to be concealed onely in his own boſome: and therefore it is vain and idle to frame arguments upon ſuppoſal that God ſhould make them revealed and commonly known to ſingular perſons.</p>
                  <p>Now to his latter queſtion; Who, if he did believe the decrees of abſolute Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination and Reprobation, would not <hi>curſe his birth-day?</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer, No well-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed Chriſtian who underſtandeth what the abſolute decrees of Election and Prete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition do import. If the decree of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation imported a neceſſary cauſing of any mans ſinnes by the Divine powerfull ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:135677:155"/> or an abſolute decree of damning any ſingular perſon, whether innocent or ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, whether a believer or not-believer, there were ſome reaſonable motives for men Not-elected, knowing ſuch a decree, to curſe their birth-day. But this falſe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination hath been often refuted.<note n="o" place="margin">

                  <p>Whereas he maketh the caſe of the non-elected angels better then of men, becauſe they <hi>know</hi> and <hi>expect damnation</hi> (he might have added, <hi>and feel the torments of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) and men not-elected are <hi>fed up with vain hopes, and made believe that</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not periſh but <hi>defectu voluntatis propriae;</hi> We anſwer, Firſt, That thoſe which are now damned devils, were not damned for their Non-election, or becauſe they were not elected from eternitie, but for the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall act of their apoſtaſie. And the ſame we ſay of men not-elected. Secondly, we anſwer, That the now-damned devils did not <hi>know</hi> or <hi>expect</hi> their damnation when they were firſt created, and whileſt they were <hi>viatores;</hi> though now they be under damnation, they muſt needs both know it and feel it.

And laſtly we anſwer, That the Non-elect are not thereby appointed to wrath, but the wrath of God layeth hold upon them for being children of Belial and diſobedience, and not for being perſons not-elected. And it is moſt true, that if they periſh, they periſh not <hi>defectu miſericordiae Divinae,</hi> who hath offered them means of grace, pardon, and ſalvation; but <hi>defectu voluntatis propriae,</hi> wherein there is alwayes found a voluntary pravity, a neglect, a contempt, or a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked abuſe of the means of ſalvation ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered unto them.

               </p>
               <p>But now they cannot in <hi>(D)</hi> juſtice be bound to believe, if they be abſolute Reprobates, for three cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they have no power to believe: they want it, and muſt want it for ever. God hath decreed they ſhall never have any to their dying day. <hi>Nemo obligatur ad impoſſibilia,</hi> No man can be juſtly tyed to impoſſible performances. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man can flie like a bird, or reach heaven with the top of his finger, therefore God cannot with juſtice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act of any the performance of theſe actions: nor can he of Reprobates the obedience of Faith, if it be not poſſible to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is <hi>(E)</hi> not Gods unfeigned will they ſhall believe. No man will ſay that it is Gods ſerious will that ſuch a man ſhall live, when it is his will that he ſhall never have the concourſe of his providence and the act of preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Nor can we ſay that God doth in good earneſt will that thoſe men ſhould believe, whom he will not furniſh with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary power to believe. It may rather be ſaid, it is Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned will they ſhall not believe, becauſe it is his will they ſhall want power to believe. For it is a Maxime in Logick, <hi>Qui vult aliquid in cauſa, vult effectum ex iſta cauſa profluen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:135677:161"/> He who willeth a thing in the cauſe, willeth the effect that neceſſarily floweth from that cauſe. Now if it be the certain will of God that Reprobates ſhall in no wiſe believe, he cannot with reaſon and equitie tie them to believe: for then he tieth them to an act contrary to his determinate will.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe they have <hi>(F)</hi> no object of faith, no Chriſt to believe in. <hi>Credere jubet, &amp; fidei nullum objectum ponit,</hi> He commandeth to believe, and affordeth no object to believe in: this ſoundeth not well. The devils have no part in Chriſt or the new covenant: we will not therefore ſay that God can juſtly bind them to believe, or puniſh them as tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours of the covenant becauſe they believe not: How then can we ſay that God can juſtly require faith of Reprobates, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them for not believing, if they have indeed no more part in Chriſt or in the covenant then the devils have? If a man ſhould command his ſervant to eat, and puniſh him for not eating, and in the mean time fully reſolve that he ſhall have no meat to eat, would any reaſonable man ſay that ſuch a man were juſt in the command or puniſhment? Change but the name, and the caſe is the ſame. Again, that Chriſt died for Reprobates (by the doctrine of abſolute Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation) is a lie; and can God juſtly bind men to believe a lie?</p>
               <p>This is the ſecond reaſon.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The third reaſon why the abſolute decree infringeth Gods juſtice, is, becauſe it will have him <hi>(G)</hi> to puniſh men for omiſſion of an act which is made impoſſible to them by his own decree: not by that decree alone by which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to give them no power to believe, having loſt it; but by that decree alſo by which he purpoſed that we ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with Adam in his ſinne, and be ſtripped of all that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall power which we had by Gods free grant beſtowed upon us in Adam before he fell.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the reaſons which move me to think, that this abſolute decree is repugnant to Gods Juſtice.</p>
               <p>Three things are uſually anſwered.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That Gods wayes may be very juſt, and yet ſeem unjuſt to mans erring underſtanding: and ſo is this decree, though fleſh and bloud will not yield it to be ſo.</p>
               <p>This anſwer <hi>(H)</hi> I take to be falſe, and the contradictorie to it to be true; namely, That nothing is truly juſt which humane underſtanding purged from prejudice? corrupt affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:135677:161"/> and cuſtomes, hath in all ages, places and perſons judged to be unjuſt. The reaſon is, Becauſe God hath by the light of nature, and thoſe generall impreſſions of good and evil, honeſt and diſhoneſt, juſt and unjuſt, made in the hearts of men, ſufficiently inſtructed and enabled them to judge what is juſt and what is not. When a thing is done, reaſon ſo qualified is able to ſay, This is juſt, or, This is unjuſt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be done by God or man. For (virtues in men being but the image of thoſe perfections that dwell in God) Juſtice in men and God are for ſubſtance but one and the ſame thing, though infinitely differing in degree, as the greater and leſſer light. That this power is ingraffed in men, God himſelf (who beſt knoweth with what endowments he hath beautified his creature) hath ſufficiently ſignified in thoſe Scriptures where he calleth on men to be judges of the equitie of his wayes: <hi>Judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard,</hi> Eſay 5. <hi>Judge, O ye houſe of Iſrael; are not my wayes equall, and your wayes unequall?</hi> Ezek. 18.25. God would never put them upon the triall of reaſon, if he had not made it able to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them. The incarnation of the Sonne of God, his birth of a virgin, his dying, the reſurrection of the bodie, and ſuch myſteries as are peculiar to the Goſpel and the proper objects of the Chriſtian faith, God hath not offered to the triall of our underſtandings, but rather derideth thoſe that preſume to judge of them by reaſon: 1. Cor. 1.20. <hi>Where is the ſcribe? where is the wiſe? where is the diſputer of this world?</hi> And the reaſon is, Becauſe theſe things being ſupernaturall, and therefore not diſcernable by naturall power, man is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent judge of them by his naturall underſtanding, nor may adventure upon the triall and judgement of them with leſſe danger then Uzzah looked into the ark: for <hi>ſcrutator maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatis opprimetur à gloria,</hi> He that prieth into Gods majeſtie, will be overwhelmed of his glorie. But of the juſtice of his decrees and wayes he maketh him a judge, becauſe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notions of juſt and unjuſt being imprinted in nature, he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s able by naturall reaſon to apprehend what is juſt in Divine acts as well as in his own.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It is anſwered, That theſe decrees are ſet down in Scripture to be the will of God; and therefore they muſt needs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This anſvver doth not ſatiſfie me. For I grant that God is ſimply and abſolutely bound to no man, becauſe he is <hi>agens liberrimum,</hi> a moſt free diſpenſer of his ovvn favours, where, and vvhat, and to vvhom he vvill; and no man is aforehand with God: <hi>Quis prior illi dedit ut retribuatur?</hi> Who hath given unto him, and it ſhall be recompenſed again?

If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath made a promiſe of any gift or grace to men, his promiſe bindeth him to performance.</p>

We ſhall find God alvvayes giving ſtrength vvhen he giveth a command. When he commanded the creatures to <hi>increaſe and multiply,</hi> he gave them a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying virtue: When Chriſt bade the lame man <hi>ariſe, take up his bed and walk,</hi> he put into his limbs an abilitie of vvalking. When Adam had a ſpirituall lavv given him to obey vvhich vvithout ſpirituall ſtrength he could not, God gave him ſtrength anſvverable to the law, as Divines agree, conſenting to that noted ſpeech of S.

               <p>That I may bring this home to my purpoſe, I ſay, That God is bound to reſtore unto men povver to believe, ſuppoſing theſe things that follovv: 1. That he hath vouchſafed to enter into a nevv covenant of peace with men, vvhen he need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not; 2. That in that covenant he requireth obedience at mens hands, even at theirs that periſh; 3. That he promiſeth eternall life to every man, if he obey and keep the covenant; 4. That he puniſheth the diſobedient vvith ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting death. Theſe particulars ſuppoſed, the moſt free God, vvho is abſolutely bound to none, is engaged to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie of believing unto men: Nor can he juſtly vvithout this gift puniſh the diſobedient, any more then a Magiſtrate
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:135677:163"/> having put out a mans eyes for an offenſe, can command this man with juſtice to reade a book, and becauſe he readeth not, put him to death; or then a Maſter (that I may return the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile</hi> in the anſwer) when he hath taken avvay from his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant the ſtock vvhich he hath miſimployed, can aftervvard exact of him a juſt imployment of the ſame ſtock, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him becauſe he imployeth it not.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, That the abſolute and inevitable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of ſuch men as are called to believe in Chriſt, and puniſhed if they believe not, is utterly repugnant to the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God, and therefore can be no part of his vvord.</p>

That God may without any injuſtice abſolutely decree from all eternity to give in time more naturall gifts, more ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil honour, more ſupernaturall graces and mercies to one man then to another, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all reſpect to foreſeen differences of goodneſſe or badneſſe in the perſons.

That God cannot juſtly ſubject men to the torments of hel but for their ſinnes and finall ending of their life in ſinne. The reaſon, Becauſe if he ſhould either puniſh an innocent man or a penitent ſinner, he ſhould do an act contrary both to his goodneſſe and truth: And this is onely it which may be termed injuſtice when we ſpeak of God.</p>
                  <p>Unto the places of Scripture which he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> ſetteth in the front of his diſcourſe, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:135677:165"/> in a word, That Predeſtination and Non-predeſtination, or Election and nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Reprobation, as they concern this or that ſingular perſon, are not promiſed or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed: and therefore to elect Peter and not to elect Judas is not contrary either to the goodneſſe or truth of God, and ſo not to his righteouſneſſe or juſtice. For thoſe places of Scripture which aim at Gods vindicative juſtice, as it is threatned onely againſt men guilty of ſinne, they no way concern the point in queſtion. For the abſolute diſtinct decrees of the Divine Predeſtination or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terition are no acts or parts of his vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice; but they are free and abſolute acts of that ſovereigne dominion which he hath in preparing and diſpenſing the effects of his goodneſſe (which by promiſe are due to no man) according to the rule of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute will and pleaſure.</p>

God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving juſtly decreed that Adams children ſhould participate with him in his ſtate of righteouſneſſe, did as juſtly decree that they ſhould alſo participate in the ſtate of ſinne.</p>
                  <p>If this Authour deny the propagation of ſinne from Adam, he muſt acknowledge himſelf a Pelagian. If he ſay it is unjuſt, which all Divines acknowledge to have happened according to the decree of God, I ſee not how he can clear himſelf from that crime wherewith he chargeth others.</p>
                  <p>His whole diſcourſe concerning originall ſinne and the propagating thereof unto all mankind, is erroneous, in that he falſely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth that the Divine decrees muſt needs be effective or cauſative of all the events de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed:
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:135677:166"/> Whereas if the events be actions ſinfull, Gods decrees are permiſſive and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinative, not decrees of cauſing, much leſſe neceſſitating, ſuch evil actions, as hath been often told him. Be it granted that it is <hi>all one in ſubstance to decree the miſery of an innocent man, and to involve him in a ſinne that he may be brought to miſery:</hi> We deny that the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite decrees of Predeſtination and Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition are decrees cauſing any innocent mans miſery, or decrees involving, that is, (as this man underſtandeth it) neceſſarily cauſing any mans ſinne whereby he is brought to miſery. For in Calvines opinion (with whom now he dealeth) the decrees of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination and Reprobation find all men in the ſtate of ſinne and miſerie: That which cometh after is never the cauſe of that which went before. As for thoſe who conſider Election and Preterition before the abſolute previſion of ſinne, they will never grant that negative Reprobation or Non-election was the adjudging or decreeing of innocent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or men unto eternall miſery or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but a decree of permitting innocent angels and men to incurre eternall miſery and puniſhment, and of not delivering them or freeing them out of that miſerable eſtate. He is but dim-ſighted in this controverſie, who ſeeth not a formall difference in theſe decrees: So that God may juſtly do the one,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:135677:166"/> though he cannot without croſſing the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary revealed courſe of his Juſtice do the other.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond reaſon why abſolute Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is againſt Gods Juſtice, is, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>I hold it improper to ſay that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth or bindeth any man to believe his own Predeſtination or Election, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> though ſome learned Divines ſpake in that manner. My reaſon is, Becauſe we are bound by way of command to believe that onely which the Prophets and Apoſtles were bound to preach unto us: Now Gods Miniſters ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had, neither now have, any commiſſion to preach the Predeſtination of this or that ſingular perſon unto any man, though they are bound in the judgement of charity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude no ſingular perſon out of the number of the elect. That which the Miniſters of the Goſpel require of us for the atteining of ſalvation is faith in Chriſt: and that which they command us concerning Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or election, is not the immediate belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it as of an article of faith which they have in commiſſion to preach unto us,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:135677:167"/> but the doing of thoſe things from whence <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> the Spirit of God bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto our ſpirit, we come to have a comfortable and lively perſwaſion or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Adoption and Predeſtination: So that this perſwaſion, aſſurance, or belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of a mans ſingular Election, is rather <hi>ſolatium</hi> then <hi>mandatum,</hi> a comfort which God by his holy Spirit worketh in thoſe who endeavour to live a ſober, juſt and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, then a command which God by his Miniſters enjoyneth this or that man parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to believe.</p>
                  <p>As for believing in Chriſt, we grant that God by the Miniſters of the Goſpel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all men to whom Chriſt is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to believe in him: And in this command our common and wel-known conditions of being ſinners and ſtanding in need of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our are onely to be reſpected, not the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct unknown conditions of men in Gods eternall and ſecret counſel predeſtinated or not-predeſtinated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> But why is this command unjuſt <hi>quoad non-electos?</hi> The decree of Preterition nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taketh away any <hi>power</hi> of doing well, wherewith perſons not-elected are endued; as we ſee verified in the non-elect angels, who were not ſtripped of their power of ſtanding by Gods decree of Not-electing them: neither is it a decree binding Gods
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:135677:167"/> hands from giving them ſufficient grace to do many good acts, which they wilfully refuſe to do. For Sufficient grace may ſtand with Non-election or Reprobation; though Effectuall grace doth not, as Divines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly teach.</p>
                  <p>And laſt of all, for <hi>power of believing;</hi> I would know what power many millions of men have to believe in Chriſt (though re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated no otherwiſe then the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants acknowledge eternall Reprobation) who never heard nor ever ſhall heare of Chriſt? When he hath ſhewed me what power of believing theſe men have, I will more eaſily ſhew him that any not-elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſon living in the Church hath the ſame, if not a nearer and greater.</p>
                  <p>As for his terms of <hi>Poſsibilities</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsibilities;</hi> they are ſo full of equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that it is hard to ground a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them. That is not impoſſible for any <hi>Viator</hi> to do for doing whereof it is poſſible for God to give ſufficient grace. Now it is eaſie for God to give any not-elected perſon ſufficient grace to repent and believe without any infringing of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decree of his Non-election. Again, that is not to be judged abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a man to do which, if himſelf by a voluntary act of his own hindred not, might by him be done. And thus we ſay the Non-elect
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:135677:168"/> have a power or poſſibilitie to believe or repent at the preaching of the Goſpel: which power might be reduced into act, if the voluntary frowardneſſe and reſiſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their own hearts were not the onely hindering cauſe. Other power then this the Remonſtrants know not how to find in all thoſe whom themſelves acknowledge to be under the immutable decree of eternall Reprobation. In their opinion therefore as well as in ours, when God commandeth reprobated or non-elected perſons to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, believe and finally to perſevere, his commands ſhould be contrary to juſtice, becauſe ſuppoſing the perverſeneſſe and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary reſiſtance of their wills (which God hath decreed to permit) their believing and perſevering is impoſſible.</p>

And this we call abſolute Reprobation.

<pb n="335" facs="tcp:135677:171"/> bound himſelf to do the one way or the other, he will ſhew himſelf much mistaken, if he accuſe God of injuſtice for every act which would be very unjuſt were it done by men. Pride, fulneſſe of bread,<note place="margin">

And to end in that exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of infants, ſo often urged by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour; If an earthly king or judge, being able to hinder, ſhould ſuffer thouſands of his harmleſſe infant ſubjects to be torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with pains, to be vexed by devils, to be ſnatched away with ſudden death, he would be deemed careleſſe, unjuſt, cruel: God ſeeth, and oftentimes ſuffereth all this to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall poore little babes, being moſt able to prevent it: call theſe doings of God to triall of humane reaſon, and it will never be able

                  <p>But he deceiveth himſelf, Firſt, in that he will needs parallel and ſquare the Divine ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice unto the rule of civil and humane ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, not onely where God hath brought upon himſelf <hi>debitum fidelitatis,</hi> by promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or covenanting to do thus; but where he hath reſerved unto himſelf <hi>liberriman poteſtatem</hi> of doing or not doing, of doing this or the contrary. For example, if God ſhould not ſhew mercy upon every ſinner that repenteth, reaſon would ſay he dealt not juſtly; as it ſaith of men when they break their promiſe: But if God decree to ſoften one mans heart, and give him the grace of repentance and perſeverance, and not to give the ſame graces to another, here it is not right reaſon, but blind and bold
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:135677:172"/> reaſon, which chargeth God with injuſtice. If God ſtrike a petty ſinner preſently and ſpare a grand ſinner till he be old in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſuffering him to do much miſchief, and knowing that he will do much miſchief if he be ſpared, neither the ſudden ſtriking of the leſſer ſinner nor the longer ſparing of the greater is contrary to Divine juſtice: and yet ſuch dealing is not according to the rule of humane civil juſtice allowable.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this man is deceived, in ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Juſtice of God (which is to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to the goodneſſe of his own nature) to be ſuch a rule as reſtraineth him, if he will be juſt in his dealings, to one part of the contradiction. The rule of juſtice which tieth men to do juſtly, is ſuch a rule as ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them unjuſt when they do otherwiſe. But (as I noted formerly) in things where there is no expreſſe covenant or promiſe on Gods part, if he ſhould pretermit that which he doeth, and do that which he pretermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, if he ſhould deal more mercifully with this man then he doth, or more ſeverely with that, there were no injuſtice in it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unbeſeeming the Divine goodneſſe. Impoſſible therefore it is to reduce Gods juſtice in his decrees or acts to the rules of reaſon or humane juſtice; ſince when theſe judge a decree or an action to hold ſquare w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> the rule of juſtice, they judge the preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting

                  <p>To his further reply we ſay, That the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of abſolute Predeſtination and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terition do no more draw after them an <hi>ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable damnation</hi> of any man then the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Predeſtination and Reprobation which the Remonſtrants admit of. This hath been already proved, and therefore whileſt he ſuppoſeth this, he beggeth a falſe principle which muſt never be granted him. We confeſſe that abſolute Reprobation clogged with thoſe calumnies which he layeth upon it, of Making God the <hi>cauſe of ſinne,</hi> of Neceſſitating mens wills unto their <hi>inevitable damnation,</hi> muſt needs appear odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto right reaſon: But it is calumniati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not right reaſon, which impoſeth theſe conſequents upon the abſolute decrees of Election and Non-election. Right reaſon rightly illuminated and ſanctified will never forbid a Chriſtian to believe that God without any injuſtice might abſolutely have elected and predeſtinated many whom he hath left <hi>inter non-electos,</hi> and might abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely have left <hi>inter non-electos</hi> many whom he hath predeſtinated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="L"/> What he ſaith to our third anſwer, is quite-beſides the cuſhion. Firſt, becauſe we maintein that the abſolute decrees do no more hinder God from giving any man a <hi>power</hi> of believing, or eſchewing this or that ſinne, then the conditionate decrees for
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:135677:174"/> which he ſtriveth. Secondly, becauſe for Election and Non-election, and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of effectuall grace flowing from the one and denegation of effectuall grace following the other, God was not tied ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way by any revealed <hi>ordination</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> as this Authour erroneouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth.</p>
                  <p>As for Gods <hi>law which cannot be kept without ſupernaturall grace;</hi> we ſay, Men are as capable of any ſupernaturall grace, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered under the abſolute decrees maintein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by S. Auguſtine and by the Church of England, as conſidered under the conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decrees of late framed by Arminius and embraced by the Remonſtrants.</p>
                  <p>For his further pains in labouring to prove that God is <hi>bound to restore unto men power to believe;</hi> it needeth no anſwer till he have proved that the decree of Reprobation as it is fanſied by the Remonſtrants, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God this libertie, and as it is taught by us bindeth Gods hands. We have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red already, that the decree of abſolute Non-election or negative Reprobation may ſtand with ſufficiency of grace; and doth ſtand in our opinion with that kind of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie which the Remonſtrants themſelves are forced to flie unto. For they never dare maintein, that God giveth unto every man reprobated in their ſenſe <hi>proximam po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:135677:175"/> credendi;</hi> nor dare they maintein a ſufficiency of ſaving grace adminiſtred and beſtowed upon every ſingular perſon in the world. But they come in with limitations &amp; exceptions; <hi>In cauſis univerſalibus, Niſi per eos ſteterit, Niſi defecerint gratiae oblatae,</hi> and the like. All this we can admit as well as the Remonſtrants, and turn it to our advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. For as it is a proof of abſolute Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination or Election, to have ſuch grace prepared for a man as abſolutely effecteth the end to which it is given; ſo it is a proof of abſolute Non-election or negative Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to have ſuch grace onely prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and given to a man as through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of his own will worketh not that good end to which it ought to have ſerved.</p>
                  <p>I conclude therefore, That abſolute Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination and Reprobation are no more contrarie to the Juſtice of God then the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian Predeſtination and Reprobation founded upon the previſion of ſuch good or bad acts as men will do after they are born into this world.</p>

If any man vvould go about to challenge him with untruth, his challenge vvould eaſily appear to be a calumny: The truth of God like the glorious ſunne vvill break through all the clouds of falſe accuſations that ſeek to obſcure it. <hi>Simile gaudet ſimili,</hi> Like loveth his like: <hi>God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth ſuch as are true of heart,</hi> Pſal. 51.6. and hath an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite in utter deteſtation: and therefore he muſt needs be true himſelf. No man (for ought I know) doubteth of it.

               <p n="1">I. In his <hi>(A)</hi> Commands. For by this doctrine God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth thoſe men to repent and believe whom he ſecretly purpoſeth ſhall not believe.<note n="i" place="margin">

                  <hi>Though God command reprobates to believe the goſpel, yet he will not have them believe,</hi> ſaith Piſcator. Novv vvhom God commandeth to believe &amp; repent; thoſe he vvilleth outvvardly ſhould believe and repent; for by his commandments he ſignifieth his good will and pleaſure: and he muſt invvardly and heartily vvill it too, or elſe he diſſembleth. For vvords, if they be true, are an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the mind: vvhen they are not, they are mere impoſtures and ſimulations.</p>
               <p n="2">II. In his <hi>(B)</hi> Offers of grace and glory, vvhich he maketh to ſuch as refuſe them and periſh for refuſing them, as vvell as to thoſe vvho do accept them to their ſalvation. This is evident, Eſay 65.2. <hi>I have ſpread out my hands all the day long.</hi> To whom? <hi>to a rebellious people.</hi> and Matt. 22. vve reade, that thoſe men were invited to the vvedding that came not. &amp; Acts 3.26. there it is ſaid to the Jevvs vvho had <hi>denyed Christ,</hi> as verſ. 14. <hi>To you hath God ſent his ſonne Jeſus to bleſſe you, in turning every one of you from your iniquities. How oft</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>would I have gathered you?</hi> ſpeaking of ſuch as neglected their viſitation, and ſo loſt their ſalvation. It is evident alſo by reaſon. For as many as are under the commandment, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the promiſe too, as vve may ſee Acts 2.38, 39: <hi>Repent, and be baptized every one of you, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt: for to you and your children is the promiſe made.</hi> In which vvords Peter maketh the command and the promiſe of equall extent, both univerſall. And there is cauſe
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:135677:176"/> vvhy: For he maketh the promiſe his motive to perſvvade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the command: and it vvould not have reached home, if it had not reſpected all thoſe to vvhom the command was given. No man, reprobate or other, thinketh any leſſe, Every man that heareth the Goſpel preached, taketh himſelf to be under the gracious offer of eternall life, and upon theſe thoughts hath ſome deſires, ſome hopes of it, and ſtirreth up himſelf to forſake ſome pleaſing ſinnes vvhich othervviſe he vvould not part vvith, and do ſome unvvelcome duties vvhich othervviſe he vvould not do. But novv Gods meaning is (by this doctrine) that the moſt of thoſe to vvhom he offereth his grace and glory, ſhall have neither. And ſo Piſcator ſaith,<note n="k" place="margin">

                  <hi>Though God in words proteſt he would have reprobates to believe, yet indeed he will not have them.</hi> They make God to deal vvith men in matters of ſalvation as the poets feigne the gods to have dealt with poore Tantalus: They placed him in a clear and goodly river up to the very chin, and under a tree vvhich bare much ſweet and pleaſant fruit that did almoſt touch his lips: but this they did vvith a purpoſe that he ſhould taſt of neither: for vvhen he put his mouth to the vvater to drink, it vvaved avvay from him; &amp; vvhen he reached his hand to the fruit to have eaten of it, it withdrevv it ſelf preſently out of his reach, ſo as he could neither eat nor drink. Juſt ſo dealeth God with reprobates, by their doctrine: He placeth them under the plentifull means of ſalvation, offereth it to them ſo plainly that men would think they might have it vvhen they vvill, and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth fully they ſhall never have it, vvithholding from them either the firſt grace that they cannot believe, or the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond grace that they cannot perſevere.

                  <hi>A man muſt believe that he is predeſtinate, or elſe he maketh God to mook him when he calleth him.</hi> A man therefore that is not predeſtinate but an abſolute reprobate, vvhen he is called to ſalvation, is but deluded: It is the neceſſary reſultance of their ſpeeches.

               <p n="3">III. In his <hi>(C)</hi> Threats and Comminations alſo by this doctrine is God made to be hollovv and deceitfull. For againſt what ſinnes are threats denounced? Alwayes againſt actuall ſinnes: We never read that they are thundered out againſt us for originall ſinne: They intimate therefore that the ſinnes for vvhich men go to hell, are their actuall tranſgreſſions. But if it be true that God decreed men to hell for originall ſinne, that vvhich thoſe threats import and ſignifie is not true, and ſo God is not ſincere in them.

Will ye not be made clean? When will it once be?</hi> Can God ſpeak thus to reprobates, vvho by his ovvn decree ſhall never repent nor be ſaved, vvithout the deepeſt diſſimulation?</p>
               <p>That vvhich is uſually ſaid to clear the abſolute decree from this crimination, is, That God vviſheth the ſalvation of the reprobate ſeriouſly, but not abſolutely: he vvould have thoſe men ſaved vvho are not ſaved, but yet upon condition they vvill repent and believe: And therefore, though they do periſh, yet God is candid and ſincere in his offers of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them: for therefore do they periſh, becauſe they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form not the condition, and not becauſe God offereth not ſalvation ſeriouſly unto them.</p>
               <p>But this anſvver is too ſhort. It is true <hi>(F)</hi> indeed, God vvill have all men to be ſaved upon condition onely that they vvill believe and repent, according to that ſpeech of S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, <hi>Deus vult omnes ſalvari, ſi &amp; ipſi velint,</hi> God would have all to be ſaved, if they themſelves vvould. For if he vvould abſolutely have it ſo, vvhat can hinder it? vvho hath reſiſted his vvill? And it is true likevviſe, that a conditionall promiſe may be ſerious as vvell as an abſolute: but then the condition muſt be poſſible to them to vvhom the promiſe is made, and the performance of the condition muſt be a part of Gods vvill as vvell as the ſalvation promiſed; or elſe the promiſe cannot be candid and ſincere. <hi>Conditio eſt oblata po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téſtas aliquid eligendi,</hi> A condition is the offer of a povver of choice.

And it is in circumſtance a great deal vvorſe. For it is a deniall under colour of the contrary, a deniall joyned vvith a ſcoff, a deriſion, as vvas that of the Jebuſites, 2. Sam. 5.6. who told David that he ſhould not enter into the fort of Zion <hi>except he took away the blind and the lame.</hi> Their meaning vvas, They would never deliver it up unto him: and becauſe they thought it impoſſible for him to take avvay the blind and the lame, they told him if he did ſo, then they vvould yield it up. It vvas an ironicall and ſcoffing deniall of his demand. If the King ſhould make an unrepealable law, that no Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſhould be made a citizen of London or free deniſon of the Kingdome, and then make a decree to give ſome bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full gratuities, but to the citizens of London or to the ſubjects of the Kingdome onely, and to none but them; and yet for all this ſhould command it to be proclaimed, that he vvill give them to the Germanes upon condition they will be made free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of London, or be incorporated into the Kingdome: vvould not any man ſay, that the King in this caſe did diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and delude the poore Dutchmen? And if any ſhould ſay, there vvould be no diſſembling in it; for if they vvould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come citizens or ſubjects, they ſhould have the promiſed gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuities: a man might truly anſvver, that therefore the King doth counterfeit and coſen them, becauſe he maketh a tender of them upon a condition not poſſible by his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree. In like manner, if God haue made a decree, that ſuch men ſhall never believe, and yet offer them heaven on conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they will believe; it may moſt truly be ſaid, that God doth not onely denie them heaven, but denie it with a bitter deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which is farre from that candour and goodneſſe that dwelleth in him.</p>

                  <head>Anſwer. Whether abſolute Reprobation oppugne the Truth and Sinceritie of God.</head>
                  <p>VVE grant it is impoſſible for God to be either <hi>untrue</hi> in his ſayings and promiſes, or <hi>hypocriticall in his dealings</hi> or actions: And here we might in one word cut the ſinews of his whole diſcourſe with this generall Anſwer, That the eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Election and Reprobation, as they were terminated unto ſingular perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had any being in nature, are not uttered or declared by any revealed word, promiſe, ordination, or convention made betwixt God and us. Be the decrees there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereby ſome are elected eternally, others eternally non-elected, never ſo abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, they cannot <hi>oppugne</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> of Gods word or fidelitie of his promiſe, where no word or promiſe was ever revealed or made to any man. As for Gods dealings and temporall actions with men, there is no more difficultie in clearing them from hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie holding Election and Reprobation as we do, then there is, holding it as Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius doth.</p>
                  <p>But let us come to ſatisfie his particular <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> objections. Firſt, abſolute Reprobation argueth not hypocriſie in God, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing belief or repentance unto any man. The
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:135677:179"/> reaſon is, Becauſe when God commandeth any thing which is good, juſt and holy, he truly and unfeignedly liketh and loveth ſuch actions, and can do no other, his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall goodneſſe and holineſſe terminating <hi>voluntatem Divinae complacentiae</hi> unto all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actions by whomſoever performed. If God ſhould command any perſon not-ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to believe, to live ſoberly, juſtly and godlily in this preſent world, and ſhould diſlike him for ſo doing, here were diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling: but to command Cain or Judas to repent and believe, though God from all eternitie purpoſed to denie them that ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all effectuall grace without which he knew they would never repent or believe, here is no diſſembling. Gods commands intimate what is well-pleaſing unto him, if it be done, not what himſelf by ſpeciall grace prepared for ſome men hath eternally and infallibly purpoſed to make them do. God is not truly ſaid to purpoſe that the repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate ſhould not believe, unleſſe it could be ſhewed that the cauſes of their unbelief flow from his eternall decree or purpoſe of Non-election.</p>
                  <p>The Remonſtrants will not denie that the decree of Cains or Judas his Reprobation was both eternall &amp; immutable;<note place="margin">Corvinus.</note> neither can they affirm that God eternally and ſecretly in his own counſels purpoſed to make them
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:135677:179"/> repent or believe, but onely to adminiſter ſuch graces unto them as ſhould either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them or leave them inexcuſable. We ſay the ſame: and therefore a ſecret pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of making them not believe, can be no more faſtened upon our doctrines then upon theirs; becauſe that is onely a defect or an omiſſion, and therefore muſt be reduced onely to the defective will of man, and not to Gods will or purpoſe, which cannot be the cauſe of deficiencie.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, abſolute Reprobation doth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> not oppoſe Gods truth in his offers of grace and glorie to ſuch as refuſe them and periſh for refuſing them. If it did, the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants were in no better caſe with their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Non-election or Reprobation founded upon an eternall infallible preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, then we that found the diſtinct decrees upon Gods abſolute will. For this preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſuppoſed, Arminius himſelf granteth an eternall, immutable and abſolute decree,<note n="a" place="margin">Decl. ſeat. pag. <hi>47.</hi>

                  <p>For grace offered; <hi>Gods meaning</hi> muſt alwayes be interpreted according to the
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:135677:180"/> known nature of the means, and not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the unknown will of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the infallible event or ſucceſſe of the means. Gods meaning when he offereth any grace unto men, is, that they ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form ſuch actions whereunto ſuch grace conduceth: And his meaning when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth glorie to any man if he believe and perſevere, is, truly to perform it if he do ſo. But it is not alwayes Gods abſolute will to cauſe men to uſe his grace unto their own good, nor to cauſe them to perform thoſe conditions unto which eternall glorie is promiſed. If the Remonſtrants will have nothing termed <hi>Gods meaning</hi> but this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute will, in their opinion as well as in ours it will follow that God had no mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give Cain or Judas ſaving grace or glorie.</p>
                  <p>As for his <hi>poeticall</hi> fiction, it will make no more againſt us then himſelf; becauſe there is no power or grace by his conditionate Predeſtination and Reprobation afforded unto perſons not-elected, which may not be as well afforded according unto our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as we have often already ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Zanchius</hi> and <hi>Bucers</hi> opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the command of <hi>believing</hi> a mans ſingular <hi>Election</hi> or <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> I have formerly expreſſed my judgement, which I ſubmit unto the learned. If there were

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> For Gods <hi>Wiſhes, Expoſtulations, Commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerations,</hi> and the like, it will not follow that they are feigned and mere deluſions, becauſe the eternall immanent decrees of Election or Reprobation are abſolute and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: For were it ſo, the Remonſtrants can no better defend themſelves from theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections then we. But it muſt here be firſt of all conſidered, that <hi>Reprobatio aeterna nihil ponit in reprobato.</hi> It putteth onely in God a firm decree of permitting ſuch perſons to fall into finall ſinne, and for it a firm decree of condemning them unto eternall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This being granted on all ſides, it cannot reaſonably be conceived that God ſhould properly be ſaid to wiſh the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or ſalvation of Cain, Judas, or any not-elected perſon. They are (as before hath been touched) things in the firſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſimply good; and therefore <hi>ſimplex com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placentia Divina</hi> doth properly agree unto them: and that is all which can be truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from ſuch wiſhes, either in our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or the doctrine of the Remonſtrants. And this is enough to defend them from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deluſory, though God have eternally decreed to permit Cain and Judas to abuſe the means of repentance, and to continue in their impenitency.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Expoſtulations,</hi> we ſay they imply <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicentiam Divinam</hi> againſt ſuch perſons and
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:135677:182"/> actions as croſſe the revealed law of Gods will: and this is a true and not feigned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure: But they do not import that God wanted power to have converted ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and to have wrought their wills unto the practice of the contrary good actions, had he eternally decreed to ſhew them this ſpeciall mercy. Neither do they import that God had made no ſuch decree of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or withholding from Cain and Judas that ſpeciall grace without which he knew they would ruſh upon their everlaſting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>As for the Divine <hi>Commiſeration</hi> of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it ſheweth that their death and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not things primarily well-pleaſing unto God: but it ſheweth not that God muſt become an hypocrite and a diſſembler, if he have eternally decreed to permit them to incurre death &amp; damnation by their own default. For Gods mercy being <hi>actio ſuble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantis</hi> and not <hi>paſsio condolentis,</hi> it tieth him not to do all he can for redeeming any man out of his miſery; but his action is ordered and limited by his own free-will. It is the height and riches of Gods mercy which from everlaſting hath prepared for the Elect onely, and in time beſtoweth upon them onely that ſpeciall &amp; effectuall grace which infallibly bringeth them unto glory. It is a lower degree of mercy (and yet true mercy
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:135677:183"/> too) which is ſhewed to the Non-elect or Reprobate, in preparing for them and beſtowing upon them ſuch means of grace as by their own default are made ineffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall.</p>
                  <p>And it is not contrary to Divine mercy to decree this permitting of them to the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of their own free-will, that ſo the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect may ſee what a broken reed they lean upon, who will have the eternall decree of their Election and Salvation founded on their own foreſeen good acts of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, faith and perſeverance, and not upon any ſpeciall mercy of God predeſtinating them to theſe good and gracious acts, and ſo infallibly bringing them unto the kingdome of glory.</p>
                  <p>To diſcover briefly the main point where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Authour deceiveth himſelf in this whole diſcourſe, it is this; He thinketh all is feigned and hypocriticall which God doeth or offereth unto men not-elected <hi>in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine ad ſalutem,</hi> if he have eternally decreed to permit them to fail in the uſe of ſuch means and to continue impenitent, if he have eternally decreed to condemne them for this their voluntary rebellion. Other abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Reprobation then this we defend not: and if this maketh Gods dealings with the Non-elect hypocriticall, we muſt deny the decrees of Predeſtination and Reprobation,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:135677:183"/> or at leaſt deny them to be eternall, which no judicious Divine will ever do.</p>
                  <p>For his ſpeech uttered in the perſon of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> God, from whence he would inferre, that if in the decree of Reprobation it be certain &amp; immutable that Cain, Judas, or any other perſons not-elected, ſhall never repent and be ſaved, then all which God ſaith or doeth for the converting or ſaving of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is <hi>deep diſsimulation;</hi> many errours may be deſcried in thoſe few lines.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, he ſuppoſeth the eternall acts and decrees of Predeſtination and Reprobation to be uncertain <hi>quoad eventum,</hi> and to be mutable in time into the contrary. A groſſe errour even in the ſchool of Arminius. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he ſuppoſeth Non-election or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to be an act of <hi>hatred</hi> towards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and men not-elected; which hath been proved falſe. Thirdly, he imagineth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Predeſtination and Reprobation to <hi>ſeal</hi> men <hi>up under a neceſsity</hi> of doing well and being ſaved, or of ſinning and being da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mned: whereas they ſtand well with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of mans will. Fourthly, he implyeth that whereas God uſeth means to effect any good end in men, if he have eternally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to permit them to abuſe thoſe means, &amp; to condemne them eternally for abuſing them, that this argueth <hi>diſsembling</hi> in God. All theſe erroneous imaginations diſcover
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:135677:184"/> themſelves in that ſhort ſpeech. And that which yet more diſcovereth the weakneſſe of his inference; The eternall and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble decrees of Predeſtination and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as they are conceived by the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants themſelves) ſhould make all Gods temporall ſayings and dealings with repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated perſons, feigned and hypocriticall, if there were any manner of ſtrength in his manner of reaſoning.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> The abſolute decree of Reprobation tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly underſtood doth no more oppoſe the truth of Evangelicall <hi>promiſes,</hi> then the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian or Remonſtrants Reprobation: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it make the <hi>conditions</hi> one jote leſſe <hi>poſsible</hi> then theirs: neither doth it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any <hi>will</hi> in God of ſuch mens converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or ſalvation which they according to their opinion can truly affirm to be in God. We profeſſe ingenuouſly, that the eternall decree of Non-election or negative Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, doth put <hi>in mente aut voluntate Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> abſolute deniall of that ſpeciall effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual grace whereby the Creatour intendeth to bring his creature infallibly unto glory. And if the Remonſtrants ſay that the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Reprobation of ſingular perſons (as it is laid down by themſelves) doth not contein the ſame negation, they ſay that which they are never able to maintein.

               </p>
               <p>For this end alſo is the Patience <hi>(E)</hi> of God (another ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular dignation of God) exerciſed among men: as we may ſee Rom. 2.4. <hi>Deſpiſeſt thou the riches of his goodneſſe and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, not knowing that the bountifulneſſe of God leadeth thee to repentance? but thou after thy hardneſſe and heart that cannot repent, heapeſt-up wrath to thy ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. In theſe words may be noted for our purpoſe 1. Gods intent in forbearing ſinners; which <hi>is the leading of them to repentance,</hi> and ſo on to ſalvation: for repentance is <hi>per ſe ordinata ad ſalutem,</hi> by him ordained to ſalvation, as a means to the end. 2. The perſons to whom God intendeth this good by his forbearance: And they are ſuch as <hi>deſpiſe the riches of his goodneſſe,</hi> and have <hi>hard and impenitent hearts.</hi> 3. The iſſue and event of this their contempt of Gods patience, and that is <hi>a treaſuring-up of wrath unto themſelves againſt the day of wrath.</hi> Out of all which layed together ariſeth thus much, That God by ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring wicked men who have hard and impenitent hearts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth their everlaſting good, though they by the abuſe of his patience and refuſall to repent do treaſure-up unto themſelves wrath and miſery everlaſting. The like to this is delivered in 2. Pet. 3.9. <hi>God is not ſlack,</hi> ſaith Peter, <hi>(as ſome men count ſlackneſſe) but patient toward us?</hi> that is, us men. And why patient toward us? <hi>becauſe he would have none to periſh.</hi> The end therefore of Gods patience is mans Salvation and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
               <p>In the laſt place thoſe other gifts of God, by which mens underſtandings are enlightened and their ſouls beautified, namely Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, Fortitude, Liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Temperance, Humility and Chaſtity, and ſuch like, are beſtowed upon all that have them (among whom are many who prove reprobates in the end) that by the exerciſe of them and continuance in them they might come to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>
               <p>That reprobates are adorned with many of theſe graces, appeareth by ſundry Scriptures, eſpecially Heb. 6.4. where the Apoſtle ſaith, That it is <hi>impoſſible for them that have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened,

               <p>We ſee by theſe things what end God aimeth at in his gifts of men.</p>
               <p>But there are ſome Scriptures that ſeem to ſay the contrary; namely, Rom. 1.20. where God is ſaid to reveal himſelf to the Gentiles by the creatures, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>that they might be without excuſe.</hi> and Luke 2.34. Simeon ſaith of Chriſt, that <hi>he is appointed for the falling and riſing again of many in Iſrael.</hi> and 1. Cor. 1.23. <hi>I preach Chriſt,</hi> ſaith S. Paul, <hi>to the Jews a ſtumbling-block.</hi> and 2. Cor. 2.16. <hi>We are the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of death to death,</hi> &amp;c. By theſe places it ſeemeth that God giveth theſe things to ſome to make them ſtumble and that they might be left without excuſe. What ſhall we ſay therefore to theſe places?</p>
               <p>Of all theſe places in generall I may ſay this, That they are to be underſtood of the end which is many times effected by theſe gifts of God, and not of the end which is primarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in them; and they ſhew what Chriſt, the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the gifts of nature and grace are occaſionally to ſome men through their voluntary rebellion againſt God and his ordinances, and not what they are intentionally in Gods firſt thoughts and reſolutions: He intendeth them for their good, though many times they receive them to their hurt. It is with Gods ordinances and gifts (and that very often too) as it is ſometimes with phyſick; It is given <hi>(H)</hi> by the Phyſician for the patients good, but many times through the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of his body it doth him hurt: And as it is with the ſunne; God intendeth by the ſhining of it the enlightening and clearing of men and other creatures in this inferiour world; and yet ſome men are hurt by the light of it, others are ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the heat of it accidentally, by reaſon of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates wherein they live, or the ill-affectedneſſe of their eyes and bodies. So the bleſſings of God, which out of his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant goodneſſe are beſtowed on men for their eternall good, through their ill frame and temper of heart do effect their hurt: partly becauſe lighting on naughty hearts, they loſe their edge; for <hi>quicquid recipitur, recipitur ad modum recipientis:</hi> and partly becauſe of the ſeverity of God, who as he hath an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent and gracious will to do men good, ſo he hath a
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:135677:189"/> conſequent and judiciarie will of giving-up obſtinate men to their own hearts luſts, and of permitting them to daſh againſt Chriſt and other means of eternall life, and ſo to fall into endleſſe miſerie and miſchief, as we may ſee Pſal. 81.11, 12. and Rev. 22.11. Which made Proſper ſay,<note n="u" place="margin">

                  <hi>They that have deſpiſed Gods inviting will, ſhall feel his revenging will.</hi> Now if this be the meaning of theſe Scriptures, then do they not thwart that which hath been ſaid of Gods gracious intent of promoting the eternall good of men by his bleſſings beſtowed upon them. For <hi>argumentum ab eventu ad inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem Dei non valet:</hi> becauſe no ſinfull event is properly under Gods decree, but his preſcience onely, or at moſt under a permiſſive decree; and many things happen in the world which are beſide the antecedent and principall purpoſe of God: not becauſe there is any want of power in God, but becauſe his will is oftentimes conditionall, and therefore not effected becauſe the condition is not performed.</p>
               <p>But by the opinion of abſolute Reprobation the gifts both of Nature and Grace have another <hi>(I)</hi> end: Either God doth not mean them to thoſe that periſh, although they do enjoy them, becauſe they are mingled in the world with the Elect, to whom onely they are directed; or if he do, he meaneth they ſhall have them, and be lifted up by them above the common rank of men, <hi>ut lapſu graviore ruant,</hi> that their fall may be the greater.

                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, That if we ſpeak exactly and properly,<note n="a" place="margin">Aquin. part. <hi>1.</hi> qu. <hi>19.</hi> art. <hi>1.</hi>

<pb n="375" facs="tcp:135677:190"/> ſed ipſemet eſt finis reſpectu omnium quae ab eo fiunt.</hi> It is therefore a falſe imagination to think that the Divine will is moved by any thing but by it ſelf.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, it is to be noted, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Gods eternall volitions or decrees de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend not upon any temporall object or cauſes as the prime motives thereunto; yet God by his eternall abſolute decree may and doth ordain that this event in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall execution ſhall not follow but upon that going before: as, that the benefit of eternall life, in the actuall introduction unto the heavenly kingdome, ſhall depend upon the acts of repenting, believing and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; and that the puniſhment of eternall death, in the actuall abjection of men into hell, ſhall depend upon their own finall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitencie and ſin-guiltineſſe. This is not to make the eternall decrees of Election and Reprobation dependent upon the foreſeen contingent acts of mans freewill, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants do; but to make temporall events, acts, or things, one to depend con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally upon another for their being or not-being in time, which we willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="376" facs="tcp:135677:191"/>3. Thirdly, It is to be obſerved, That when we ſay this or that is the end of ſuch an action of God or of ſuch a gift of God, we muſt not conceive that it was the end which cauſed the Divine volition, but it is the end whereunto men ſhould uſe ſuch gifts, and the benefit which they ought to make of ſuch temporall gracious actions vouchſafed unto them. So that when we ſay, God giveth or doth ſuch a thing to ſuch an end, the meaning is, The things conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their own nature, as they come from God, have a fitneſſe or aptneſſe to produce ſuch an end. And thus God is ſaid in his gifts or actions to intend an end two wayes: The one is in the order of common Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, where the means have a naturall fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to produce ſome good end, though abuſed by men they oftentimes produce the quite contrary, God foreknowing it and decreeing to permit it ſo to be. The other is the order of ſpeciall Predeſtination, where ſuch gifts or actions of God have not onely a fitneſſe in their own nature to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch good effects or ends, but they have from the abſolute will of God an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacitie actually and infallibly producing thoſe intended ends. Of this intention onely that rule muſt be underſtood,<note n="b" place="margin">Aqu. in <hi>1.</hi> part. qu. <hi>10.</hi> art. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note>

<pb n="377" facs="tcp:135677:191"/> cadit ſub praedestinatione.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, no decree of God can truly be ſaid to croſſe the good end whereunto his gifts ought to be uſed, unleſſe it can be proved that by ſuch a decree the abuſe of them is inforced or at leaſt cauſed in wicked men. As for example; The honour and exaltation of Pharaoh unto a kingdome was a gift or a good means fitting him to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice; yet he abuſed it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to oppreſſion: The plagues inflicted upon his countrey were fit means to have hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him, and to have made him yield unto Gods command; yet he turned them to greater pride and obſtinacie: Yet becauſe no decree of God cauſed the obſtinate wickedneſſe of Pharaohs heart, the decree of permitting him to abuſe ſuch gifts unto his own deſtruction was not contrary unto the uſe or end whereunto thoſe gifts and actions of God had a fitting ordination in their own nature. Theſe things premiſed we come unto our particular anſwers.</p>
                  <p>What he ſaith concerning the <hi>gifts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or Grace,</hi> namely, That they are given for the good of thoſe upon whom they are beſtowed, we willingly yield. And therefore we let the 363 and, 364. pages paſſe without contradiction. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly let this be remembred, That the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which is meaſured by the nature of
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:135677:192"/> the means, for the event is often fruſtrated by the default of mans will, and yet Gods ſimple and abſolute will never fruſtrated. Nay, it was Gods abſolute will to permit ſome men to fail in reaping that good which by ſuch means was intended unto them. Neither doth this inferre any contrarietie or croſſing betwixt Gods Decrees and his Gifts or Graces. We do not therefore deny that mans ſalvation is the end of thoſe means, gifts and graces which God offereth unto any man <hi>in ordine ad ſuam ſalutem:</hi> But we affirm that this may ſtand with an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall abſolute decree of not-preparing for ſome men any ſuch effectuall grace as God knoweth would eaſily convert and ſave them, and with an abſolute decree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them by their own voluntary rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion to incurre eternall damnation. And this is the abſolute decree of Reprobation, which is not contrary to the end of Gods gifts: becauſe to permit men to abuſe them, doth neither alter the nature of the gift nor the ordination which it hath in it ſelf to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch an end, nor cauſe the ſinner to turn thoſe good means to his own perdition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 
                     <hi>Our Divines at Dort</hi> did truly teach, That the word, and the illuminations and motions of Gods Spirit, are ordained by God for the producing of repentance and faith in mens hearts, and for the ſaving of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:135677:192"/> their ſouls. And they further taught, That where ſuch ſpirituall and ſupernaturall means fail to produce thoſe ends, no poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, actuall, proper or true cauſe can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged beſides their own defective and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious will.</p>
                  <p>The ſaying of Proſper is unadviſedly brought-in by this Authour. For every man knoweth that Proſper, as well as his Maſter S. Auguſtine, held abſolute Predeſtination and Preterition or negative Reprobation; and therefore in his opinion the abſolute decree of Reprobation is not contrary unto any ends which God hath in beſtowing the means of grace and ſalvation upon thoſe which abuſe them: For it is impoſſible that God ſhould croſſe himſelf in his decrees, gifts, or actions. Again, Proſper, in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>gracious vocation</hi> to be afforded unto all thoſe who have been enlightned by the <hi>preaching of the Goſpel,</hi> doth imply, that where the Goſpel was never preached nor Chriſt known, there is no ſuch vocation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſaving grace. How this will agree with Arminius his new-moulded Predeſtination and Reprobation, who in his third decree bringeth-in God decreeing<note n="d" place="margin">Doct. Sent. pag. <hi>47.</hi>

But there is a will not onely ordaining means to the end, but of cauſing men to uſe the means unto the conſecution of the end. And thus by giving them ſpeciall grace God willeth the kingdome of glorie onely unto the Elect. The former will is not to be baffled with the name of diſſimulation, becauſe this latter is onely it which bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men unto glorification. And we further adde, That the Reprobates in reſiſting the former will, which is <hi>vera voluntas ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis complacentiae,</hi> do alwayes fulfill the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is Gods abſolute will of permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this reſiſtance, and of gathering out of it a greater illuſtration of his own glorie.</p>

Theſe two different manners of willing and working the ſalvation of men, do demonſtrate an abſolute will in God of Saving ſome, which we call the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute decree of their Election; and an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute will of Permitting others to draw upon themſelves damnation by voluntary abuſing the means of grace, which we call abſolute Reprobation.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> The doctrine of abſolute Election and Reprobation inferreth, That God had not an abſolute will by thoſe means of grace which he beſtowed upon the non-elect an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or men to bring them unto glorie; and that he had an abſolute will to permit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to abuſe them, to the procuring of their own eternall miſerie: And yet he that ſhould ſay, that God by giving the non-elect angels ſuch excellent indowments, or by giving Cain and Judas ſuch fatherly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, did in thoſe means aim at their deſtruction, ſpeaketh both ignorantly &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely. For the aim of God, and the end of any good gift which he vouchſafeth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, is to be meaſured by the nature of the gift it ſelf, and not by the perverſe uſe which God ſuffereth the receivers to make of it.</p>

                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="M"/> God hath <hi>abſolutely determined</hi> from all eternitie to permit ſome men to incurre <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> for contemning the <hi>conditionall</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes offered by the <hi>Miniſters.</hi> The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters <hi>witneſſe</hi> nothing but this, That God will ſave every man that believeth in his Sonne.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> His <hi>plea for Reprobates</hi> will not hold good. For (as hath been already often proved) Reprobation taketh away no power from perſons reprobated according to our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which it taketh not away according to theirs. It debarreth not God from giving any power to believe, or repent, or perform any good act, being admitted according to our doctrine, which it will permit him to give according unto theirs. For Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may ſtand with Poſſibilitie of obeying God and being ſaved, as it did in the angels reprobated; it may ſtand with Sufficient
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:135677:204"/> grace: but the truth is, neither in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants opinion nor in ours it ever doth or can ſtand with Effectuall grace. Before the world was, God had reſolved never to give unto Cain or Judas or any other perſon reprobated according to the Reprobation allowed by the Remonſtrants, that ſpeciall grace which ſhould cauſe them to believe in Chriſt, and free them from their voluntary impenitencie. Yet it is a falſe aſſertion, That God willeth they ſhould never believe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver repent: For here the word <hi>Will</hi> noteth <hi>voluntatem complacentiae;</hi> and the acts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and repenting are alwaies well-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and agreeable unto this will of God, though it be his eternall abſolute will in ſome men not to work them.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Sacraments</hi> in the Remonſtrants opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="O"/> do not <hi>ſeal</hi> an infallibilitie of ſpeciall grace or ſalvation unto any man reprobated from before the foundations of the world were laid: for then they ſhould ſeal a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt falſhood. But let them ſhew any grace or benefit which a reprobate may partake by the Sacrament, and is according to our doctrine excluded from it, <hi>without his own default, onely by the abſolute will of God,</hi> and then he ſpeaketh to ſome purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Gods <hi>gifts</hi> by the decree of Reprobation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="P"/> are neither made <hi>unprofitable</hi> nor <hi>dangerous.</hi> For (as hath been formerly manifeſted) the
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:135677:205"/> decree of Reprobation changeth not the proper nature or true ordination of Gods gifts towards perſons not-elected. If we ſpeak of the future event onely, it is moſt true, that they will <hi>never do them good in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to their eternall glorification.</hi> And this Authour cannot truly affirm that ever they ſhall, unleſſe he can alſo truly affirm that ſome men reprobated, as the Remonſtrants hold Reprobation, become afterwards glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified or ſaved. And yet he will not grant, that God out of <hi>hatred</hi> giveth his gifts unto reprobates, <hi>that they ſhould uſe them ill, and ſo be damned:</hi> No more will we. It is a weak or rather <hi>non-conſequence,</hi> That <hi>Gods choicest gifts are</hi> by God <hi>intended as ſnares unto men</hi> reprobated by his eternall decree, becauſe he hath decreed to permit them ſo to abuſe thoſe gifts, and hath decreed to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold from them that ſpeciall mercy and effectuall grace which onely maketh men <hi>de facto</hi> uſe Gods grace to the atteining of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. So that I may now conclude, There is no one amongſt ſo many objections brought againſt Reprobation, as we teach it, that is of any validitie: or if it be, it maketh as much againſt that eternall immutable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Reprobation which the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants themſelves are forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>

                  </note> It is a doctrine that ſerveth greatly to diſcourage holineſſe and encourage profaneneſſe: It maketh Miniſters (by its naturall import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) negligent in their preaching, praying, and other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices vvhich are ordained of God for the eternall good of their people: It maketh people careleſſe in hearing, reading, praying, inſtructing their families, examining their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, faſting and mourning for their ſinnes, and all other godly exerciſes: In a vvord, it cutteth aſunder the very ſinews of religion, and pulleth avvay the ſtrongeſt inducements to a holy life.

               <p>That it doth ſo, it vvill appear by theſe reaſons that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p n="1">I. It taketh <hi>(A)</hi> avvay Hope and Fear; Hope of atteining any good by godlineſſe, Fear of ſuſteining any hurt by vvicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: and ſo it taketh avvay tvvo principall props of Religion. This reaſon may be reſolved into theſe tvvo branches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hope and Fear uphold Godlineſſe. Were it not for theſe, it vvould come to ruine: by theſe are men ſtrongly led on to virtue, and vvithheld from vice. Hope doth <hi>excitare,</hi> ſtirre men up to begin, and <hi>corroborare,</hi> ſtrengthen them in the doing of any good action begun. By this hope of heaven did our Saviour ſtirre up himſelf to <hi>endure the croſſe, and deſpiſe the ſhame,</hi> Heb. 12.2. By this he heartned his diſciples to do and to ſuffer for his ſake, Matth. 5.11. and Matth. 10.32. By this have all the godly in all ages encouraged themſelves in wel-doing: as vve may ſee in generall, Phil. 3.20. Col. 1.9. Tit. 2.12, 13. and in particular, Heb. 11. Abraham left his countrey and kindred at Gods call, <hi>becauſe he looked for a citie whoſe builder and maker was God,</hi> verſ. 8.9, 10. Moſes left all the <hi>pleaſures</hi> and <hi>treaſures of Egypt, and endured af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions with the people of God, becauſe he ſaw him that was inviſible, and had reſpect to the recompenſe of reward,</hi> v. 25, 27. The Martyrs <hi>(B)</hi> endured racks, gibbets, lyons, ſvvord, fire, vvith a world of other torments, <hi>becauſe they looked for a better reſurrection,</hi> verſ. 35. Paul endeavoureth <hi>alwayes to keep a clear conſcience,</hi> through the hope vvhich he had of a bleſſed reſurrection, Acts 24.15. All the noble and heroick acts of active and paſſive obedience have ſprung from the
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:135677:206"/> hope of eternall glory. Souldiers, Merchants, Huſbandmen, all are vvhetted-on by hope to diligence in their callings, as dayly experience ſhevveth us.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aquin.</hi> 1.2, <hi>qu.</hi> 40. <hi>art.</hi> 8.</note> Hope, ſaith Aquinas, <hi>confert ad operationem,</hi> conduceth to action: and he proveth it, firſt by Scripture, 1. Cor. 9.10. <hi>He which eareth and threſheth, muſt ear and threſh in hope.</hi> and then he proveth it by a two-fold reaſon; 1. From the nature of Hopes object, vvhich is <hi>bonum arduum &amp; poſſibile haberi,</hi> ſome excellent good attein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by induſtry. <hi>Existimatio ardui excitat attentionem,</hi> Hope to get that by pains vvhich is conceived to be a thing of vvorth, ſtirreth up to pains-taking. 2. From the effect of Hope, vvhich is <hi>delectatio,</hi> an invvard pleaſure, vvhich the party that liveth under hope is affected vvith by his hope. There is not any man vvhich hath an invvard contentment and ſatiſfaction of heart in the vvork he hath to do, but goeth on merrily. The Hope of heaven therefore is a great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to piety.</p>
               <p>The Fear <hi>(C)</hi> of hell alſo is a ſtrong curb to hold men in from impiety: And therefore (ſaith one) God hath planted in men a fear of vengeance, that by it, as the ſhip by the rudder, the ſoul may preſently be turned aſide from any rocks, gulfs or quickſands of ſin, when it is near them, &amp; may ſteer its courſe another vvay. For this cauſe <hi>fear of God</hi> and <hi>absteining from evil</hi> are often joyned together in Scripture Job 1.1. Exod. 1.17. and the vvant of this fear is made the root of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſſe in ſinning, Gen. 20.11. Nor doth fear onely hinder a bad action, but it promoteth a good. It hindreth a bad action directly, becauſe it is <hi>fuga mali,</hi> a flying from that evil of miſery vvhich is annexed to the evil of ſinne: and it promoteth a good action accidentally, becauſe men think that they are never ſo ſafe from the miſchief vvhich they fear, as vvhen they are exerciſed in ſuch employments as tend to the getting of a contrary ſtate. <hi>Work-out your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>with fear and trembling;</hi> implying that the vvorking-out of ſalvation goeth not on handſomely, except the fear of miſſing it be an ingredient into the vvork.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond <hi>(D)</hi> branch of this reaſon is, That by the abſolute decree Hope and Fear are taken avvay. For Hope is properly exerciſed about <hi>bonum poſſibile haberi,</hi> ſome good thing vvhich may be obteined, not vvhich muſt be obteined of neceſſitie: and the object of Fear is <hi>malum poſſibile vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ari,</hi> an evil that may be eſcap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d. For <hi>metus eſt fuga mali,</hi> fear is a fleeing from evil; and therefore ſuppoſeth the evil to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydable.
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:135677:206"/> For no man vvill flee from an evil that cannot be prevented; but vvill yield up himſelf to it, as Ceſar did his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the murderers in the ſenate-houſe. Novv, by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, heaven and hell are not objects poſſible but neceſſary: Heaven ſhall unavoydably be obteined by thoſe that are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and hell muſt as certainly be endured by thoſe that are reprobated. For men have no power to alter their eternall ſtates: All men by this decree are preciſely determined <hi>ad u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> to one ſtate, to neceſſary ſalvation or neceſſary damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vvithout any povver or liberty to chooſe vvhether.</p>
               <p>And from hence this concluſion is clear, That the abſolute decree taketh avvay the chiefeſt inducements to holineſſe and deterrements from vvickedneſſe, and conſequently hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a godly life exceedingly.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The injuriouſneſſe of this doctrine to a godly life may further appear by theſe conſiderations that follovv, one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon another.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Abſolute and peremptory <hi>(E)</hi> decrees are inevitable, vvhatſoever the things be about vvhich they are exerciſed: and mens everlaſting ſtates if they be abſolutely determined, are altogether undeclinable. <hi>Stat fati lex indeclinabilis,</hi> The lavv of Deſtiny is undeclinable. And the reaſon is, Becauſe it hath an inevitable cauſe, the adamantine decrees of almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, vvhich are indeclinable two wayes. 1. Irreverſible, lyable to no repeal (as the ſtatutes are vvhich are made in our Parliaments) but farre more unalterable then the lavvs of the Medes and Perſians. <hi>As I have ſpoken, ſo will I bring it to paſſe: I have purpoſed, and I will do it,</hi> Eſay 46.11. Men do many times bite-in their vvords again, becauſe they utter things raſhly; and do repeal their ſtatutes and ordinances, becauſe they ſee ſome inconvenience in them being made, vvhich they could not foreſee: but God never calleth-in his decrees, becauſe they are all made in great vviſdome. 2. Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible. It lyeth not in the power of any creature to diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null them. <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> Rom. 9.19. <hi>Our God is in heaven: he doth whatſoever he will,</hi> Pſal. 115.3. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is once concluded by his abſolute vvill, is no vvayes alterable by the vvill of man. It is more poſſible for a man to hinder the riſing of the ſunne or to ſtay his courſe in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to ſtop the revolutions of the yeare, and overturn the vvhole courſe of nature, then to make the leaſt change in any of Gods abſolute decrees.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Mens actions <hi>(F)</hi> about ends and things determined by
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:135677:207"/> an abſolute decree are vain and fruitleſſe: And the reaſon is, Becauſe they cannot make them othervviſe then they are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be. It is abſolutely decreed, the devils ſhall be da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mned: Were it not a fruitleſſe thing in them by prayers, tears, and endeavours to ſeek to alter it? It is alſo ſimply decreed, that the ſoul of man ſhall be immortall: Is it not a labour in vain for any man to uſe means that his ſoul may be annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? It is ordained that the ſunne ſhall rule the day, and the moon the night; that the one ſhall finiſh his proper courſe in a yeare, the other in a moneth: Would not a mans endeavour to make an alteration in theſe things be unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and ridiculous? Without doubt it vvould. So likevviſe in vain do men labour to obtein everlaſting life and avoyd eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death, if there be no power and liberty in their hands to chooſe life or death, but muſt of neceſſity take that vvhich is aſſigned them, be it life or death: For by their labour they effect juſt nothing. If they be abſolutely appointed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, their hearing, reading, praying, alms-giving, and mourning for their ſinnes cannot poſſibly procure their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: damned they muſt be: And if they be abſolutely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to ſalvation, their neglect of holy duties, their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, their love of pleaſures, and continuance in a courſe of ungodlineſſe cannot bring them to damnation: they muſt be ſaved. If ſo many ſouls in a pariſh be in this manner decreed to heaven or hell, the Miniſter <hi>(G)</hi> preacheth in vain, and the people heare in vain. For there cannot one ſoul be ſaved by all his or their pains vvhich is ordained to hell, nor one ſoul be caſt avvay by his or their negligence vvhich is appointed to heaven. <hi>It is hard for thee,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to Saul, <hi>to kick againſt pricks,</hi> that is, to endeavour by thy perſecutions and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to root out my Church out of the world; becauſe the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of it is abſolutely decreed in heaven: teaching us by that ſpeech, that a mans labour in any thing vvhatſoever is never profitable, except it be exerciſed about an end attein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereby, and without vvhich the end may be loſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Men are not willing to be employed in fruitleſſe actions, if they knovv it. <hi>I ſo runne,</hi> ſaith S. Paul, <hi>not as uncertainly: ſo fight I, not as one that be ateth the aire: But I keep under my body, and bring it into ſubjection, leſt that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a cast-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</hi> The meaning is, I endeavour to keep Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; I fight vvith the temptations of the devil, the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the vvorld, and mine ovvn corruptions; I keep my
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:135677:207"/> body low by watchings and faſtings and other ſevere exerciſes of holy diſcipline. But <hi>cui bono?</hi> Do I all this at randome? uncertain whether I ſhall obtein any good or prevent any miſchief hereby? No; but I do this, as one that is ſure <hi>(H)</hi> that by ſo doing I ſhall attein everlaſting life, and without ſo doing I cannot avoid eternall death: intimating in theſe words the common diſpoſition of men, which is, to labour where ſome proportionable good is to be gotten, or evil prevented; otherwiſe to ſpare their heads and hands too. To be imployed in fruitleſſe <hi>(I)</hi> affairs, is both a Folly and a Miſery. 1. A Folly: For <hi>de neceſſariis nemo ſapiens deliberat,</hi> No man uſeth deliberation about things neceſſary, ſaith the Philoſopher. And our Saviour ſpeaking of things above our power, <hi>Cur eſtis ſoliciti?</hi> ſaith he to his diſciples, Matth. 6.27. Luke 12.25, 26. <hi>Why take ye thought</hi> about ſuch things? Which is as much as if he had ſaid, It is an argument of folly in you to trouble your ſelves about ſuch things as lie not in your power. 2. It is a Miſery in the opinions of all men, as the fable of Siſyphus implyeth; Who (as the Poets feigne) is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in hell for his robberies, with the rolling of a great ſtone to the top of a ſteep hill, where it cannot reſt, but preſently tumbleth down again. The morall of that fable is, That it is torment, and a torment fit for hell, for a man to be ſet about any work that is fruitleſſe and in vain. Men will rather be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in high and hard imployments that produce proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable ends, then pick ſtraws, play with feathers, or with Domitian ſpend their times in flapping and killing of flies, or do any other eaſie work which endeth in nothing but aire and emptineſſe, except they be fools or ſelf-tormentours. And therefore when Balaam once <hi>ſaw that the Lord had fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to bleſſe Iſrael,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Num.</hi> 24.1.</note> and that all his ſorceries could not effect the contrary, he preſently gave-over and ſet no more enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And reaſon teacheth every man to do the like. If any man were fully poſſeſſed with a perſwaſion that his temporall eſtate were determined in heaven, and that he ſhould be worth juſt ſo much, neither more nor leſſe; he would conclude in his thoughts, that his care and pains could nothing profit him, nor his idleneſſe impoveriſh him: and ſo would quickly be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to take his eaſe. And were it evident that every Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth had <hi>terminum magnitudinis,</hi> a condition ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for it which could not be altered, and a fatall period which could not be avoided, then would the King call no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, uſe no privy Counſellours, make no laws and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances

               <p>From theſe three premiſſes <hi>(K)</hi> layed together it followeth directly, That the doctrine of an abſolute decree, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth mens ends preciſely, is no friend at all to a godly life. For if events abſolutely decreed be unavoidable, if mens actions about unavoidable ends be unprofitable, if in unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable imployments men will have no hand willingly; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they be that believe and conſider this, will have nothing to do with the practice of godlineſſe: For their ends being ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely pitched and therefore unavoidable, they will conclude that their labour in religion will be unprofitable, and ſo will not labour in it at all.</p>
               <p n="3">III. That which hath been ſaid may be yet confirmed by two witneſſes. The one of them is <hi>(L)</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Calvine: Who in his Inſtitutions hath theſe words;<note n="f" place="margin">

                  <hi>If any man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhould ſpeak thus to the people, If there be any among you that believe not, it is becauſe ye are ordained to deſtruction; this man would not onely cheriſh ſlothfulneſſe, but wickedneſſe alſo.</hi> Which is as much to ſay (me thinks) as this, If a man ſhould ſet forth the doctrine of Reprobation in its colours, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it to people in a clear and lively faſhion, he would here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by open a doore to liberty and profaneneſſe. The other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is a man of another ſtamp, the miſerable Landtgrave of Thuring: Of whom it is recorded by Heiſterbachius, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by his friends admoniſhed of his vitious converſation and dangerous condition, he made them this anſwer,<note n="g" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>I conclude therefore, That by this opinion (which is taught for one of Gods principall truths) Religion either is or may be made a very great loſer: which is my fourth generall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt it.</p>
               <p>But there are three things which are uſually anſwered to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate this opinion from this crimination. Firſt, That many <hi>(M)</hi> of them which believe and defend this doctrine, are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and good men: and therefore of it ſelf it openeth no way for
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:135677:208"/> liberty of life, but through the wickedneſſe of men who uſe to pervert the ſweeteſt and ſureſt truths of Scripture to their own damnation.</p>
               <p>The like defenſe to this did the Epicures of old make in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of their ſenſuall and ſwiniſh doctrine; which was, That happineſſe conſiſted in pleaſure. They ſaid that many of their ſect were honeſt men: and ſo much Tully granteth to be true, but with exception ſtill againſt their doctrine;<note n="h" place="margin">

                  <hi>I take,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Epicurus himſelf to be an honeſt man: yea and many Epicures have been and are faithfull in friendſhip, ſquare and conſtant men in all conditions of life, ordering themſelves and their lives not by pleaſure but by duty.</hi> But (ſaith he)<note n="i" place="margin">Hoc vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur major vis honeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, minor voluptatis.</note> this proceeded not from the principles of their opinion, but from their own vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous inclination: and the <hi>force of honeſty by their ſo doing, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be more prevailing in them then the force of pleaſure,</hi> which they pleaded for.

                  <hi>As other mens doctrines are eſteemed to be better then their deeds, ſo theſe mens deeds ſeem to me to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then their doctrines.</hi> Like to this anſwer of Tully to the defenders of Epicuriſme, will I ſhape mine. It cannot (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe) be denied that many of this opinion are godly men: but it is no thanks to their opinion that they are ſo (the true and naturall genius of which is to <hi>(N)</hi> beget ſloth, to drown men in ſecurity, and to countenance carnall libertie;) but to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, either to Gods providence, (who will not ſuffer this doctrine for his own glories ſake and the good of men to have any great ſtroke in their lives;) or to mens incogitancy, who think not of reducing it <hi>ad praxim,</hi> to practice, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concluſions out of it, but reſt in the naked ſpeculation of it, as they do of many others; or laſtly, to ſome good practicall concluſions which they meet with in the word of God and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to their lives (as they do not the former deductions;) ſuch as theſe are for example, <hi>Be ye holy as I am holy.

And hence we may learn to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure this opinion, not by the lives of ſome few of the men that hold it, but by the ſequeles which the Logick even of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple men, if they ſhould apply their brains to conſider it, would fetch out of it. No man that hath throughly ſuckt it in and underſtandeth the force of it, but will either quite relinquiſh it, or live according to the naturall importment of it, that is, licentiouſly.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, becauſe he is quite miſtaken in the ſenſe of this word <hi>Abſolute.</hi> Eternall Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination is not termed an <hi>abſolute</hi> decree of ſaving David, Peter, Paul, or any man elſe, as if it abſolved perſons predeſtinate from the neceſſitie of uſing the means of ſalvation which Gods revealed word hath injoyned; (This were rather a <hi>diſſolute</hi> then an <hi>abſolute</hi> Predeſtination.) but becauſe God eternally predeſtinating David, Peter, Paul, and the reſt, hath in his ſpeciall mercy abſolutely determined to give them that ſpeciall grace which ſhall move, inable, and make them uſe all the neceſſary means unto their ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And for eternall Reprobation; it is not termed an <hi>abſolute</hi> decree of damning Cain, Judas, or the Devil himſelf, as if God were abſolutely reſolved to damne them though they ſhould never intangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in any guilt of damnation, and ſhould do all thoſe good acts which God himſelf
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:135677:217"/> hath decreed ſhall be means to bring any who uſeth them unto ſalvation: but becauſe God eternally paſſing-by them and not-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinating them, hath abſolutely reſolved to withhold from them that ſpeciall mercy, more abundant and moſt effectuall grace, without which he infallibly knoweth by their own voluntary rebellion they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre damnation, which he is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved to permit and not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, all his <hi>premiſſes</hi> are too weak to induce his concluſion, becauſe eternall abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute determinations of God concerning e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſhall betide unto particular men, do neither encourage nor diſcourage them from uſing the ordinary means of atteining good and avoiding evil, whileſt they are onely known in the generall, and altogether unknown as they concern this and that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular perſon.

                     </gap> temporall or externall good things there were more colour a great deal to ground idleneſſe upon Gods eternall determination; becauſe let a man take never ſo good courſes and ſo true pains to attein honour or wealth, he ſhall never compaſſe it if God have otherwiſe appointed: But in ſpirituall and eternall bleſſings, let any man take the courſe and uſe the means which God hath preſcribed to attein them, and he may aſſure himſelf they are infallibly appointed for him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, becauſe experience teacheth the contrary to his ſuppoſition, though we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the eternall abſolute determination of God concerning this ſingular perſons ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were revealed unto him extraordinarily by God himſelf. For the certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods abſolute determination to give eternall life, would not in a well-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed mind produce careleſſeneſſe or idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but a religious care and fervency of ſpirit in doing all ſuch actions as further man in the way unto life, and of removall of ſuch obſtacles as would hinder them. It is commonly held by Divines, that the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Virgin, S. Paul, and ſome others had an extraordinary revelation of their abſolute election unto eternall life; and yet none of theſe concluded that all their pains and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:135677:218"/> for atteining it was fruitleſſe and vain. And if God had revealed to Judas (which in his wiſdome he hath judged unfit) the eternall immutable decree of his Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet ſhould none of his endeavours to do good &amp; eſchew evil have been unprofitable.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, becauſe if men ſhould reject <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> the abſolute, irreverſible, irreſiſtible decrees of Gods eternall Predeſtination and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation which this Authour oppoſeth, under pretenſe that thereby all actions and means are made vain and fruitleſſe unto men where the ends and things are predetermined, the Predeſtination and Reprobation grounded upon Gods eternall preſcience would lie as open to the ſelf-ſame objection: Which if it be of no validitie againſt the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants, neither is it againſt us. For firſt of all, as for the eternall decrees of abſolute Election and Reprobation; <hi>nihil ponunt in electis aut reprobatis,</hi> they onely ſuppoſe in God a determination of bringing the one infallibly unto eternall life, and of permitting the other as infallibly to come ſhort of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and by their own ſinfull acts to plunge themſelves into the gulf of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death. In the Remonſtrants decree of eternall Predeſtination and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the ſame determination of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame particular men with the ſame infallibilitie and immutability of
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:135677:219"/> their contrary ends is eſtabliſhed. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the diſtinct decrees of Predeſtination and Reprobation thus irrevocably eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the world was made, make all <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in religion unprofitable,</hi> the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants own doctrine doth it no leſſe the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ours. Again, abſolute and eternall determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of God concealed <hi>in mente Divina,</hi> though never ſo infallible and immutable, cannot in ſingular perſons hinder piety or nouriſh profaneneſſe, where there are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees as immutable, as infallibly revealed unto the ſame ſingular perſons in Gods word, promiſing life to all without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that do well, and threatning death to all thoſe that do ill. How can it probably be ſuppoſed that thoſe unknown Divine deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations ſhould work upon mens wills, when theſe ſo well known and ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally publiſhed do not.</p>
                  <p>If any Remonſtrant ſhall ſay, Make me ſure of mine Election,<note place="margin">Viole Thom. à Kempis, l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>25.</hi> pag. <hi>68.</hi>

And if thou wilt not for ſuch a price adventure thy pains unleſſe God will firſt make thee of his privy counſel, eternall damnation is

                  <p>Laſt of all, the immutability of all Gods eternall decrees whatſoever is a thing out of all queſtion amongſt orthodox Divines (I need not except Vorſtius the Remonſtrant, becauſe no man reckoneth him amongſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Divines:) I wonder therefore how this Authour ſhould think he hath ſaid any thing againſt the Divine abſolute decrees of Predeſtination and Reprobation, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are <hi>peremptory, inevitable, irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> &amp;c.

If therefore the Remonſtrants Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination and Reprobation be reverſible decrees, we will none of them; for we are ſure they were never of Gods making.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Calvines</hi> ſaying is moſt true: For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of Reprobation is no cauſe of infidelity;
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:135677:220"/> though the decree of Predeſtination prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for men that grace which worketh faith and ſanctification in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Landtgraves</hi> profane ſpeech maketh as much againſt the Arminian Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as againſt that which we hold. For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Remonſtrant had told him, <hi>If you be elected, it is becauſe God hath eternally foreſeen that you will die a penitent and a faithfull man: If you be reprobated, it is becauſe God hath eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally foreſeen you will die a faithleſſe and a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man,</hi> this in all likelyhood would have been ſo far from taking away his deſperate profaneneſſe, that it would have increaſed it: for God cannot be deceived in his foreſight.</p>

                  <p>For his objection againſt the ſecond an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, we ſay, Let him underſtand abſolute Reprobation and abſolute Election as by us it hath been formerly explained, and not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his erroneous fanſie, which hath been often confuted; and it no more <hi>beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſloth</hi> or <hi>carnall liberty</hi> then the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants eternall Election and Reprobation ſpringing from Gods infallible and eternall preſcience, nay much leſſer. For according to our poſition no man can have ſo ſtrong a perſwaſion that he is elected and ſhall be ſaved whilſt he continueth in <hi>ſloth,</hi> carnall <hi>ſecurity</hi> or ſinfull actions, as he may in theirs. If it be once conceived that the eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, which diſtinguiſh men elected and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, ſtand founded upon the foreſeen finall goodneſſe of men, ſuch is the vain confidence which moſt men have of their own free-will and of the ſovereigne domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which their will hath over its own acts, that though they be never ſo wicked for the preſent, yet they are moſt ready to flatter themſelves that they will turn good and holy men before their death. And thus they
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:135677:221"/> ſpend their whole life in ſin and carnall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, whileſt they hope to put themſelves within the number of the Elect by their fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall penitencie when they pleaſe. But he that believeth that Predeſtination is an act of Gods abſolute will and free mercy, and that faith and holineſſe are the proper ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof, he can have cold comfort of his Election or Salvation whileſt he continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in his carnall and wicked converſation; nay he muſt needs be in fear of damnation: eſpecially ſince he dareth not truſt to the broken reed of his own free-will for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and perſeverance, as men of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion are eaſily induced to do. He may have ſome ſlender hope of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted at the length, becauſe it is within the limits of Gods power and mercy to do it: yet he cannot (in all likelyhood) ſo ſecurely and carnally preſume upon his finall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion and perſeverance as thoſe who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe theſe good acts unto their own free-will, and the certainty of them to the intui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive preſcience of the Divine underſtanding, and not to an operative effectuall eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of his will.</p>

                  </note> Petrus Iloſuanus <hi>(D)</hi> a Schoolmaſter in Hungary, vvho going to hang himſelf, ſignified in a vvriting vvhich he left in his ſtudie for the ſatisfaction of his friends and countreymen, the true cauſe of that his unnaturall fact. In that vvriting he delivered theſe three things. 1. That he vvas of Calvines and S. Auguſtines opinion, That men are not dealt withall <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundùm bona aut mala opera,</hi> according to their vvorks good or evil; but that there are <hi>occultiores cauſae,</hi> more hidden cauſes, of mens eternall conditions. 2. That he vvas one of that vvofull companie of abſolute Reprobates, <hi>vas forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum in ignominiam,</hi> a veſſel prepared to diſhonour; and that therefore (though his life had been none of the vvorſt) he could not poſſibly be ſaved. 3. That being unable to bear thoſe dreadfull apprehenſions of vvrath vvith vvhich he vvas affrighted, he hanged himſelf. For theſe are ſome of his laſt vvords there recorded,<note n="u" place="margin">Diſcedo igitur ad la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus inferna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les aeternum dedecus pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triae meae. Deo vos commendo, cujus miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricordia mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi negata eſt.</note> 
                  <hi>I go to thoſe infernall lakes, an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reproch to my countrey. I commend you to God, whoſe mercy is denied to me.</hi> Out of this example, tvvo things vve may ſafely collect: Firſt, That men vvho think there are many whom God hath utterly rejected out of his onely vvill and pleaſure, may be eaſily brought to think by Satans ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion that they are of that company. Secondly, That this temptation is very dangerous.</p>
               <p>I conclude therefore this firſt part of my laſt reaſon, vvhich is, That abſolute Reprobation leadeth men into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="2">II. It leaveth men in temptation: And this it doth tvvo vvayes; by 1. Making <hi>(E)</hi> the tempted uncapable of true comfort; 2. Making Miniſters unable to give true comfort.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It maketh the tempted uncapable of true comfort: Like a Gorgons head, it doth ſo trouble their fanſies and amaze them, eſpecially in their paroxyſmes and fits, that the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt arguments of comfort, applied vvith as much art and
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:135677:226"/> cunning as may be, vvill not faſten upon them. With David they ſay in their fear, that <hi>all men are liars,</hi> namely all ſuch as come to comfort them in their temptation. The reaſon is, becauſe it is an opinion incompatible vvith any vvord of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that can be miniſtred to the diſtreſſed ſoul in this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. Gods Love to mankind, Chriſts Death for all men, the Calling of poore ſinners vvithout exception to repentance and ſalvation, vvith all other grounds of conſolation, the tempted vvill eaſily elude vvith the grounds of his opinion. Which that vve may the better ſee, let us imagine that vve heare a Miniſter and a tempted Soul reaſoning in this or the like manner.</p>

And therefore by the outward call,

               <p>By this <hi>(M)</hi> we may ſee, that no ſound comfort can be faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon a poore ſoul rooted in this opinion, when he lieth under this horrible temptation.</p>
               <p>The example <hi>(N)</hi> of Francis Spiera an Italian Lawyer will give ſome further light and proof to this. This Spiera about the yeare 1548. againſt his knowledge and conſcience did openly abjure his religion and ſubſcribe to Popery, that thereby he might preſerve his life and goods and liberty. Not long after he fell into a deep diſtreſſe of conſcience, out of which he could never wreſtle, but ended his wofull dayes in deſpair. To comfort him came many Divines of worth and note: But againſt all the comforts which they applyed to him, he oppoſed two things eſpecially. 1. The Greatneſſe of his ſinne: It was a ſinne (ſaid he) of a deep die, committed with many urging and aggravating circumſtances; and therefore could not be forgiven. This argument they quickly took from him, and convinced him by the example of Peter, that there was nothing in his ſinne that could make it irremiſſible: Peter, that committed the ſame ſinne, and with ſome more odious circumſtances, repented and was pardoned, and ſo (no doubt) might he. 2. He oppoſed his abſolute Reprobation, and with that he put-off all their comforts. Peter (ſaith he) repented indeed and was pardoned, becauſe he was elected: as for me, I was utterly rejected before I was born; and therefore I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly repent or be ſaved. If any man be elected, he ſhall be ſaved, though he have committed ſinnes for number many and hainous in degree: but if he be <hi>ex repudiatis,</hi> one of the caſt-awayes, <hi>neceſſariò condemnabitur,</hi> he ſhall be ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably condemned, though his ſinnes be ſmall and few.<note n="u" place="margin">Nihil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt an multa an pauca, an magna an parva ſint, quando nec Dei miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia nec Chriſti ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis quicqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ad eos per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinet.</note> A Reprobate muſt be damned, <hi>be his ſinnes many or few, great or little, becauſe Gods mercy and Chriſts merits belong not to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this ſtory (recorded by Coelius Secundus and Calvine, with ſome others who lived at that time and wrote of it to their friends) as in a glaſſe we may ſee the diſconſolate condition of a poore ſoul that is ſtrongly conceited that the greateſt part of the world are abſolute Reprobates, and that he is one of them: He ſticketh ſo ſaſt in the myre and clay that he can very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be drawn out.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It maketh Miniſters unable to afford true comfort to the tempted: And this it doth, becauſe it 1. Taketh from them all ſolid grounds of comfort; 2. Leaveth them onely weak and inſufficient grounds.</p>

               <p>The reaſon why thoſe grounds are able to help a man in ſuch a caſe, is twofold.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they are directly contradictory to the temptation. A will to ſave all, a giving of Chriſt to death for all, a ſerious offer of grace to all, cannot poſſibly ſtand with an abſolute antecedent will and intent of caſting-away the greateſt part of mankind, or, to ſay the truth, of any one man in the world. Upon this followeth the ſecond reaſon.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe they ſerve to convince the tempted, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in that condition in which he ſuppoſeth himſelf to be.
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:135677:228"/> For if tvvo contradictories cannot be true, he that evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth the truth of the one, convinceth the underſtanding of the untruth of the other: and he that maketh it appear, that this contradictory, <hi>God would have all to be ſaved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed and called, to repent and believe,</hi> is true, putteth it out of all doubt to the underſtanding, that the other contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory, <hi>God will have most men to be abſolutely and inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably damned,</hi> muſt needs be falſe, and ſo raiſeth up that poore ſoul vvhich vvas preſſed dovvn with an erroneous conceit and fear that it vvas true. In this manner did <hi>(Q)</hi> Junius (though not in the ſame temptation) relieve a woman per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed exceedingly with a ſtrong perſvvaſion that ſhe and all her children ſhould be damned, becauſe ſhe vvas buſied about her children at a certain time vvhen ſhe ſhould have been at Maſſe. Junius maketh ſhort vvork vvith her, telleth her that her imployment about her children vvas a duty pleaſing to God, but the Maſſe vvas a mere vvill-vvorſhip; and ſo deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering her of her errour upon vvhich the temptation vvas built giveth her preſent eaſe and comfort. In like manner tell a man vvho feareth himſelf to be an abſolute Reprobate, that there are no ſuch abſolute Reprobates, and that his fear is but mere fanſie and his doubt a dream, convince him once by contradictory grounds, that there is no man in the vvorld in that ſtate in vvhich he thinketh himſelf to be, and you drive out one nail by another, and expell the temptation. Theſe are the ſvvord of Alexander, vvhich vvill cut aſunder this Gordian knot of abſolute Reprobation; and theſe are the true Nepenthes of a ſick and ſorrovvfull ſoul.</p>
               <p>But novv theſe true grounds of hope and comfort no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter can make uſe of that holdeth abſolute Reprobation; nor, if he do uſurp them, can he poſſibly maintein them againſt the replyes of the tempted, unleſſe he relinquiſh his opinion: becauſe (as I have ſaid) there is a plain contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvveen them, and no man is able to maintein tvvo propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vvhich ſpeak contrary things, to be both true, any more then he can make it good, that the ſame thing may have a being and no being at the ſame time. For example; A Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter cometh to comfort a man that thinketh himſelf to be an abſolute Reprobate: and hovv doth he ſet about it? He tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth him, That <hi>God would have all to be ſaved,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt died for all,</hi> &amp;c. But vvhat right hath he to theſe grounds of comfort ſeeing he holdeth the contrary concluſions, <hi>viz.</hi> That God will have a great many to be damned and to
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:135677:229"/> have no part in Chriſt? Well; he uſurpeth them notvvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: But is he able to maintein them againſt the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers of the tempted? or can he make a good reply? No certainly. For thus anſvvereth the tempted, <hi>God (R) would have all to be ſaved with a revealed, but not with a ſecret will: and Chriſt died for all men ſufficiently, but not intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally; or if God did intend that he ſhould die for all, yet he intended it upon a condition which he purpoſed the moſt ſhould never perform.</hi> What can the Miniſter reply to this? If he will make a direct reply vvhich ſhall take avvay the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver, he muſt deny that God hath tvvo vvills, the one oppoſite to the other, a ſecret vvill that many ſhall unavoydably be damned, and a revealed vvill that all men may be poſſibly ſaved. And he muſt alſo deny that God had an intent that Chriſt ſhould not die for a great many, or that he intended he ſhould die for all upon condition they vvould believe and repent, and yet purpoſed that the moſt ſhould never believe and repent. But can he deny theſe things? He cannot, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he deny his own concluſion, vvhich is, That there are many thouſands eternally and unavoydably rejected in Gods abſolute purpoſe from grace and glory. For that concluſion is all one vvith the anſvvers of the tempted, and contradictory to thoſe arguments of comfort which he is glad to make uſe of. Abſolute Reprobation therefore bereaveth that Miniſter who believeth it, of all ſolid grounds of conſolation, and ſo maketh him unable to recover a poore ſoul vvounded vvith this temptation.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Secondly, it leaveth a Miniſter ſome vveak grounds onely and inſufficient to quiet the tempted: and therefore it maketh him unable to comfort him. The grounds vvhich it leaveth him are inſufficient, becauſe they cannot <hi>(S)</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and make it evident to the underſtanding of the tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he is not that vvhich he feareth, that is, a Reprobate. Out of temptation probabilities vvill uphold a mans hopes (as they did Manoahs vvifes, Judg. 13.22, 23. <hi>If the Lord would kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering at our hands, nor ſhewed us all theſe things;</hi>) becauſe men are not ſo miſtruſtfull then: But in temptation men are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally very ſuſpicious and incredulous, like Jacob, who vvould not be perſvvaded that Joſeph vvas alive and a great man in Egypt, till he ſavv the chariots that vvere ſent to fetch him thither, Gen. 45.25. and like Thomas, vvho vvould not believe that Chriſt vvas riſen, till he ſavv the print of the
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:135677:229"/> nails and ſpear, John 20.25. They vvill not believe any thing that is ſpoken for their comfort, till it be made ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent that they have nothing to ſay to the contrary. My ſelf have knovvn ſome, vvho in their temptations have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten put their comforters to their proofs, to their proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nay to their oathes too, before they vvould believe their vvords of comfort. And in this temptation we ſpeak of, men are ſo ſtrongly poſſeſſed vvith the fear of eternall rejection from the face of God that they vvill not eaſily vvithout mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt conviction believe the contrary. But grounds convincing and ſatisfying a Miniſter that mainteineth abſolute Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath not in ſtore. Nothing can he ſay that is able to make it appear infallibly and undeniably to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the tempted, that he is no abſolute Reprobate. All that he <hi>(T)</hi> can ſay is, <hi>Be of good comfort: you are a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, a truly repenting ſinner; therefore no Reprobate. For faith and repentance are infallible fruits of Election, and arguments of a ſtate contrary to what you fear.</hi> But this the tempted vvill deny: He vvill ſay, that <hi>he is no believer,</hi> &amp;c. And hovv vvill the Miniſter convince him that he is? He muſt prove to him by the outvvard acts of faith and repentance (for they onely are apparent to him) that he doth repent and believe. But this proof is not demonſtrative, nor doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; becauſe <hi>opera virtutum ſimulari poſſunt,</hi> the externall acts of faith, repentance, or any other grace may be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeited. The devil may ſeem to be an angel of light; wolves may go in ſheeps clothing; Judas may make the world believe by his preaching and following of Chriſt, that he is a true Apoſtle; and Simon Magus, though he remain in the gall of bitterneſſe and bond of iniquity, may be thought by his receiving of Baptiſme to be a true believer: and ſo may any hypocrite by ſome exteriour acts of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance delude the beſt diſcerner of ſpirits among men, and gain the opinion and eſteem of a true penitent and believer. Actions externally good, or good in appearance, may be evil indeed for vvant of a good rule, manner, end, or ſome other good circumſtances with vvhich an action that is good muſt be clothed; (For <hi>bonum non oritur niſi ex integris:</hi>) and ſo by good conſequence cannot certainly prove the man vvho doth them to be a good man, or to have the grace of faith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, or any other truly planted in his heart. Which being ſo, I ſay that a Miniſter cannot <hi>(V)</hi> by the outvvard acts and fruits of faith and repentance which he ſeeth come
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:135677:230"/> from him, make it evident to the tempted, to the ſilencing of all replyes, that he is without doubt a true believer and repenting ſinner, and conſequently no Reprobate. For ſtill the tempted may ſay, <hi>You may be deceived in me: for you cannot ſee any thing more in me then hath been ſeen in many a Reprobate. And if this be all you can ſay to prove me to be none, I am not ſatisfied, I may be a Reprobate: nay I am a Reprobate, and you are but a miſerable comforter, a Phyſician of no value.</hi>

That the Elect being in this condition may indeed be comforted, but it muſt be by their ſenſe of ſinne and their deſire to be freed of it by Chriſt: vvhich proofs are but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly probable to the beſt, and to a man in temptation no proofs at all; and conſequently either no comforts or very ſmall ones.

That there is no reaſonable ground of any particular mans perſwaſion that he is either under the one decree or the other, but onely what is collected <hi>à posteriori,</hi> from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.

                  <p>That Gods Predeſtination and Non-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> or negative Reprobation are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, abſolute, and irreverſible decrees, and that they are founded in Gods free plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of ſhewing ſpeciall mercy where he will and denying it where he thinks good, is a more <hi>comfortable</hi> doctrine then that of the Remonſtrants, <hi>ſcilicet,</hi> That the forenamed eternall decrees were enacted and founded upon the intuitive preſcience of mens perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in good or bad acts.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

Our Saviours doctrine Luke 18.25. was ſo uncomfortable to his diſciples, that it made them cry out, <hi>Who then can be ſaved?</hi> yet it was not untrue.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Laſtly, whereas we are now in a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative queſtion, Whether the Remonſtrants

                  <p>Whereas he ſaith our <hi>doctrine leadeth men <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> into temptation,</hi> becauſe <hi>the devil may eaſily perſwade a man that believeth abſolute Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he is one of thoſe abſolute reprobates,</hi> there being <hi>an hundred abſolute reprobates for one abſolute elect, and</hi> there being <hi>more reaſon</hi> for any man <hi>to think that he is one of the moſt then of the feweſt:</hi> We anſwer, That <hi>abſolute Reprobation</hi> is Gods abſolute decree of not-giving unto many men that effectuall grace without which he infallibly knoweth they will never attein unto glory. And by <hi>abſolute reprobates</hi> nothing elſe can truly be underſtood, but perſons thus abſolutely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the elect in the immanent act of Gods eternall and immutable will. If this Authour have any other meaning, when he ſo often inculcateth <hi>abſolute Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation</hi> and <hi>abſolute reprobates,</hi> we leave him to fight with his own fanſies. Now the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrants in this ſenſe hold abſolute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and abſolute reprobates. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:135677:232"/> they ſet three eternall decrees in order of conſideration before they come to Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reprobation, yet they bring God in the fourth upon an eternall preſcience eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally decreeing to ſave theſe ſingular and certain perſons, and to damne theſe ſingular and certain perſons, and no other. If this laſt decree be eternall and irreverſible, if it be founded upon the eternall foreſight of their finall impenitency, God hath as abſolutely rejected many men from ſpeciall or effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grace and glory in their doctrine as in ours.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>devil</hi> may <hi>ſuggeſt,</hi> but he cannot more <hi>eaſily perſwade a man that maketh it his creed,</hi> That <hi>ex ſtatu lapſo</hi> God-hath out of his good pleaſure and mere mercy elected ſome unto the atteinment of ſalvation, and out of his abſolute will left others to the loſing thereof, then he may perſwade thoſe who make all men eternally reprobated whom God eternally foreſaw would out of their own free-will live and die impenitent. A man muſt be perſwaded that his own free-will was a more likely means to put him within the decree of eternall Election then the free mercy of God, or elſe our doctrine affordeth more hope to any man of being predeſtinated then theirs. Now there is no well-inſtructed and humble Chriſtian, who knoweth the corruption of his own free-will
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:135677:232"/> and the inconſtancy thereof, though aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſufficient grace, but will eaſilier be perſwaded to a comfortable apprehenſion of his Election or certain ſalvation, when he conceiveth it as depending on Gods ſpeciall and mere mercy, then if he ſhould conceive it as depending upon the ſpeciall good acts of his own free-will and foreſeen perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance therein unto his lives end: For this is, as S. Auguſtine ſpeaketh, <hi>Firmiori potiùs quàm infirmiori ſpem ſuam committere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for his inſtance in the ſmall number of the Elect and great number of the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, though ſpeaking of Chriſtians, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not his account of <hi>an hundred for one,</hi> yet we acknowledge the number of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect (great in it ſelf) to be ſmaller then the number of the Non-elect. But ſo it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the doctrine of the Remonſtrants: &amp; there is farre leſſe <hi>reaſon</hi> for any ſinfull man to hope <hi>that he is rather one of the feweſt then one of the moſt,</hi> when the diſcrimination muſt ariſe from the goodneſſe of his own free-will, then when it is ſuppoſed to ariſe from the mere mercy of God. If God in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decree of Election ſay, <hi>I will have mercy upon whom I will have mercy,</hi> as every man is under the ſame eſtate of miſery, ſo every man hath reaſon to conceive himſelf a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubject of this mercy, though <hi>de facto</hi> it ſhould be extended to never ſo few. But if
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:135677:233"/> in his eternall decree of Election he ſay thus, <hi>I will ſhew this ſpeciall mercy unto none but thoſe whom I have foreſeen uſing well the grace which I ſhall offer them, and continuing in the exerciſe of repentance, faith, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to their lives end,</hi> few or none can with probability otherwiſe perſwade themſelves then they are reprobates; at leaſt none of thoſe whom he imagineth to be under the forenamed tentation. For the devil may thus ſuggeſt, <hi>In your own opinion no man was elected out of Gods abſolute free-will and mercy, but all were reprobated before the foundations of the world were laid that were not foreſeen em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing Gods grace when it was offered, exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſame in the acts of faith and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and perſevering in ſo doing till their lives end. You know that there is not one of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that doth this, why ſhould you think that you are rather one of the fewest then one of the moſt? Nay, you know that hitherto you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted the motions of Gods Spirit, and obeyed your own ſinfull luſts; that if at any time your will hath had an inclination to do good, it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtarted aſide like a broken bow: how can you think that you are one of thoſe in whom God eternally foreſaw repentance, faith and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and ſo put you in the number of his Elect? Surely you are in the roll of Reprobates.</hi> The Remonſtrants doctrine doth ſo faſhion men to receive this ſuggeſtion, that unleſſe
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:135677:233"/> he will forſake his opinion of Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Reprobation upon the foreſeen good or bad acts of men, he hath nothing to keep him from deſpair, or to perſwade him that he is not in the number of thoſe who were eternally reprobated. But in our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, though a man for the preſent ſtick faſt in the filthy mire of ſin, and ſo cannot fetch any true comfort from the aſſurance of his Election, yet he is better armed againſt the devil ſuggeſting the certainty of his Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation: For he may anſwer, <hi>I confeſſe, I find my ſelf tied as yet and bound in the chains of my ſinnes; I acknowledge, I deſerve nothing but eternall damnation. And if my Election or ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation had depended upon Gods foreſight what good courſes out of mine own free-will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by grace I ſhould take and continue in, I could not otherwiſe think of my ſelf then of a man reprobated and appointed unto damnation. But I know that Gods eternall Election is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of pure mercy and not of retributive ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; that the bending of mens hearts to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, repent and perſevere are the ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall fruits of that eternall mercy, and not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall fruits of any mans free-will. Albeit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do not as yet find any ſignes or effects which can put me in comfort of my Election, yet ſo long as I am a capable ſubject of Gods ſaving mercy, all the devils in hell cannot prove my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. Nay, this very diabolical ſuggeſtion
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:135677:234"/> which by Gods providence hath affrighted my ſoul with fear of Reprobation upon the view of my ſinnes, I take as a token of Gods eternall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, beginning to rouze me out of the bed of ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and intending to do me good.</hi> So that whatſoever <hi>Calvine, Bucer, Zanchius,</hi> or any man elſe hath ſaid concerning the danger of this temptation, doth as nearly concern the Remonſtrants as it doth us. For though this Authour think to help himſelf by putting-in the term ABSOLUTE, when he ſpeaketh of Reprobation as we defend it, &amp; by leaving it out alwaies when he ſpeaketh of Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as he holdeth it, this helpeth not his cauſe at all. For we are now diſputing about the eternall decrees and immanent acts which Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines call Predeſtination and Reprobation, &amp; not about the temporall effects and externall accompliſhment thereof, unto which ſome times the name of Predeſtination and Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is alſo given. The Divine immanent act of reprobating Cain, Judas, or any other, is as abſolute a Reprobation, as irreverſible and immutable, being conceived after the Remonſtrants doctrine as after ours. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they place an act of abſolute preſcience before Reprobation, which we place after, yet both they and we acknowledge it ſuch an abſolute decree as never was nor ever will be altered. If the temporall accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the actuall Damnation of the
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:135677:234"/> Reprobate, be termed their Reprobation, we ſay as well as they. That this dependeth upon temporall conditions. For that one temporal effect ſhould depend by way of condition upon another, is agreeable to truth and right reaſon: but that an immanent eternall act of Gods will ſhould depend by way of condition upon a temporall act of mans will, is contrary to true Divinity. Reprobation therefore as it is eternally an act or decree immanent <hi>in voluntate ac mente Divina,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be abſolute.</p>
                  <p>His example of the <hi>Hungarian Schoolma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> is a poore proof againſt abſolute Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. For firſt Saint Auguſtine and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and all orthodox Divines are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that though men be not predeſtinated or paſſed-by <hi>ſecundùm praeviſionem operum bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum aut malorum,</hi> (for all men are fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen alike plunged in ſin and miſery as they are objects of Election and Non-election or Preterition) yet for ſalvation and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at the day of judgement, all men ſhall be dealt withall <hi>ſecundùm bona aut mala opera.</hi> Secondly, if this man perſwaded himſelf <hi>that he was one of the wofull company of abſolute Reprobates, and that therefore he could not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> I would know if he would have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe perſwaded had a Remonſtrant told him, <hi>There is indeed an eternall and immutable decree of Reprobation, but it made no abſolute Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:135677:235"/> but ſuch whom God eternally and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely foreſaw would die impenitent; God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that you would by the help of his mercy and grace die a faithfull and penitent man.</hi> This cold comfort which the Remonſtrants do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine giveth againſt abſolute Reprobation could never have kept this wretch from hanging himſelf. For he would have choked his comforter with the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer which made him choke himſelf, <hi>I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to God, but I find this mercy is denied to me, for I know I have an impenitent heart.</hi> Reprobation therefore which is Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decree, being as abſolute in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as in ours, it affordeth the devil the ſame matter of ſuggeſtion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Now to his ſecond argument, That abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Reprobation <hi>maketh a tempted man unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of comfort, and a Miniſter unable to give true comfort,</hi> we anſwer, That the eternall Reprobation of Cain or Judas upon an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall preſcience is more liable to this obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction then that which we defend, for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons above mentioned. No man ought to ſeek for comfort of his Election but in the fruits thereof, nor to be utterly diſcomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with apprehending his Reprobation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he be uncapable of the fruits of Election. If any be ſo diſtempered in his reaſon or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection that upon the devils ſuggeſtion he will like a wizard gueſſe at his own Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:135677:235"/> and foretell his own Damnation, it will be as hard for a Remonſtrant to remove this uncertain and ungrounded fanſie as for us.

He muſt go another way to work; wherein our doctrine will fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him better then that of the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there is no man ſo fooliſh as to think that a Miniſter can ſhew him whether he be in the number of the Elect or of the Reprobate; or that a wicked man perplexed with this doubtfull cogitation, can be ſo freed from it as to encline to the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable part, whileſt he continueth impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. All that can be done for his good, whileſt he continueth faithleſſe and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, is to perſwade him to ſuſpend the opinion of his Reprobation; whereof his own reaſon recollected is able to tell him he hath no certain knowledge. And it is a rule, <hi>De quolibet praeſumendum bonum donec conſtet contrarium.</hi> That doctrine therefore
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:135677:236"/> muſt needs be more powerfull to make a man ſuſpend the opinion of his being a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, which is more likely to bring him into ſome probable hope of his future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Now unto a man feeling the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of his own nature, and perplexed with the conſcience of his continuall volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary rebellion, and thereupon conceiving himſelf a Reprobate, what hope of his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture converſion can the Remonſtrants do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine afford him? He muſt tell him, <hi>Thou art one of thoſe whom God eternally foreſaw re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, believing, perſevering, and who haſt all theſe acts in the power of thine own will: and therefore there is great probabilitie of thy future repentance.</hi> This poor tempted wretch finding in himſelf for the preſent all things ſeeming quite contrary to what the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrant Miniſter telleth him, will rejoyn, <hi>Thou lieſt unto me; God never ſaw any ſuch goodneſſe in me: he foreſaw that in me which I now ſee in my ſelf, a wicked will and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe heart, which will hold me fettered in ſinne unto my lives end. I am therefore one of thoſe whom according to thine own doctrine God eternally reprobated.</hi> As for our doctrine, it cannot give ſuch a tempted perſon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of his future repentance, but it may give him a more probable and comfortable hope; becauſe it will referre his hope to that unſpeakable mercie of God which this
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:135677:237"/> Authour hath ſo highly extolled) and to that omnipotent power whereby God is able to work for us beyond our hope, and to produce in us both the will and the deed of repenting when he pleaſeth. There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more likelyhood of future repentance, when a ſinner is thus referred to Gods abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute will for it, then when he is referred to his own abſolute free-will: and therefore the fear of his Reprobation may in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be eaſiiyer diminiſhed by our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine then by theirs.</p>
                  <p>But I come to his Conference betwixt the Tempted perſon and the Miniſter: Where I will take leave to make our own anſwers: for I like not his.</p>

And under theſe conditions God doth not onely deſire the ſalvation of ſome men out of every ſort, but of every particular man in every ſort of men. And he hath no ſecret will contrary to this revealed will, wherein he ſhould purpoſe to damne any one man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, believing and perſevering.

When any man hath finiſhed his courſe in faith and godlineſſe, and is arrived in heaven, the event undeniably proveth that God had an eternall abſolute purpoſe of giving the grace of repentance and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance unto ſuch a man, and ſaving him by the bloud of Chriſt.

                     <p>You miſconceive Gods cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.

And I appeal unto your own knowledge and experience; Did the word preached never pierce further then your ears? hath it not inlightned your underſtanding with the wholeſome doctrine of the Goſpel? Hath not Gods Spirit at ſome time or other by the word inwardly moved you to break off your ſinfull and luſtfull courſes, and to lead a ſober, juſt and religious life? Why do you contrary to your own conſcience falſely accuſe God of affording you a bare outward calling, but no inward? Why do you traduce him as not willing that you ſhould believe, repent, and ſo be ſaved? Take it for a certain rule; God alwayes willeth men ſhould do thoſe things which by his word written he enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to do, and by his Spirit inlightning
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:135677:241"/> and inciting he ſo helpeth them to do, that it is onely the voluntary perverſeneſſe and ſtubbornneſſe of their own wills reſiſting the word and the Spirit which hindreth them from doing thoſe things which they ſhould. It is true, that God can make any hard and reſiſting heart a ſoft and obedient heart; and he doth it where he hath an eternall purpoſe out of ſpeciall mercy ſo to do: And it is as true, that God may juſtly leave a ſtubborn heart to his own reſiſtency and perverſeneſſe; and this he doth where he hath purpoſed in juſtice ſo to do. <hi>Deus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeretur cujus vult, &amp; quem vult indurat.</hi> If you long to be aſſured of this ſecret meaning or purpoſe of God towards you in particular before you reſolve upon your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, I can aſſure you that it is the devil who hath ſtirred up in you a longing after a thing impoſſible, that ſo he may procure your deſtruction.

For the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants themſelves, who acknowledge eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Election and Reprobation as well as we, confeſſe there is no middle ſort of men which are neither eternally elected nor eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reprobated; and therefore if they can aſſure a man he is not reprobated, they can aſſure him he is elected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="N"/> For the example of <hi>Francis Spiera,</hi> it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no more againſt us then againſt any who hold diſtinct oppoſite decrees of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Reprobation eſtabliſhed <hi>in mente ac voluntate Divina</hi> before the foundations of the world were laid. When the Devil ſuggeſteth unto a man, that by Gods decree he is in the number of perſons reprobated, he troubleth him not with Jeſuiticall or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian diſputations, whether a conditionate preſcience or an abſolute preſcience muſt <hi>ſecundùm noſtrum modum intelligendi</hi> be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed in the ſame eternitie unto the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall decrees of Election and Reprobation: but he taketh advantage upon that wherein we all agree, that God is not now to make his decrees who ſhall he elected and who not, but that this was a thing immutably ordered from all eternitie. Upon this true
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:135677:242"/> ground he troubleth the fanſie of a man with a ſtrong conceit that he is one of thoſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular perſons not-elected.

But whileſt a man ſtandeth poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with a fanſie of his own Reprobation
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:135677:244"/> and with a knowledge of his impenitency and fear of finall obduration, the univerſall conditionall promiſes cannot perſwade him that he is one of the Elect, or diſſwade him from thinking he is one of the Reprobate. Melanchthon therefore thought the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſalitie of the promiſe a good motive to incourage any man unto repentance: but he thought it not a good argument to prove that any man is a perſon elected, and ſhall moſt certainly repent, though he now think the contrary. This is the ſcruple, this is the deviliſh ſuggeſtion, which the conditionall promiſes, though never ſo generall, cannot remove out of the fanſie of an impenitent &amp; deſperate ſinner, ſuch an one as Spiera was.</p>
                  <p>Theſe univerſall promiſes are not <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradictory to the tentation.</hi> The tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, <hi>I Spiera am a Reprobate, and ſhall die in my finall impenitencie:</hi> The univerſall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is, <hi>Whoſoever believeth and repenteth, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Let this Authour ſhew the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>

For example; a Remonſtrant cometh to comfort a man who thinketh himſelf to be one of thoſe whoſe Reprobation God hath decreed from everlaſting upon the everlaſting foreſight of his finall impenitencie: He telleth him, <hi>God would have all to be ſaved; Chriſt died for all,</hi> &amp;c. What can the Remonſtrant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter conclude hereupon? <hi>Therefore no man was reprobated from everlaſting upon the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of his impenitencie: Therefore not you.</hi> This were to croſſe his own principles. As for an orthodox Miniſter, he will never go about to prove unto the tempted perſon that there is no ſuch thing in the world as
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:135677:246"/> ſome men abſolutely elected and others ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely not-elected: but he will ſhew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Firſt, That abſolute Election and abſolute Non-election or negative Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation are not (as he fearfully and fondly imagineth) decrees of abſolutely ſaving any man whether he repent or no, or of abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly damning any man whether he repent or no. Secondly, That it is a fooliſh and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh kind of divination for any man to put and place himſelf in the number of the Elect or Non-elect upon the mere uncertain fanſie of his own mind, or upon the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litious ſuggeſtion of the Tempter. And therefore if he would be out of perplexitie, he muſt no longer conceive himſelf certain of that whereof his own reaſon awakened will ſhew him he cannot poſſibly be certain. His tongue muſt not ſay that wherein his own knowledge giveth him the lie. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he is brought to confeſſe, that he neither is nor can be certain what God in his eternall counſel decreed of him before the world was made, he is to be inſtructed to drive away the fear of his Non-election, and to gain ſome comfortable aſſurance of his Election, by labouring to do thoſe things which become the Elect children of God, and to avoid thoſe things which are proper to the children of the devil. This was the old and onely way which the Apoſtles knew
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:135677:246"/> to gain a comfortable perſwaſion of a mans Election, and conſequently to drive away the fear or ſuſpition of being a Reprobate. If the Remonſtrants have a new way of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, I dare confidently affirm it cannot be a good way.</p>
                  <p>For his objections againſt us, of Gods <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="R"/> 
                     <hi>two oppoſite wills,</hi> the one <hi>ſecret,</hi> the other <hi>revealed;</hi> of ſome mens <hi>impoſsible ſalvation</hi> and <hi>inevitable damnation:</hi> they are his own erroneous collections. We have already ſhewed that there are no ſuch oppoſite wills in God: and that for poſſibilitie of atteining ſalvation and avoiding damnation, every man hath as much according to our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine as theirs. But becauſe this Authour never leaveth inculcating abſolute Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be a doctrine that taketh away all grounds of comfort, I muſt tell him again and again, that if he admit eternall decrees in God, of giving repentance and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance unto Peter, and of not-giving it unto Judas, of giving eternall life unto Peter, and of not-giving it unto Judas, let him ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe or imagine what act of Divine preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he pleaſeth to be precedent unto the forenamed decrees, Judas was as abſolutely under the decree of Reprobation, and ſo as abſolute a Reprobate, in his doctrine as ours. For the eternall will of God is altogether abſolute, which decreeth a future event,

                     <hi>conſideratis conditionibus adjungendis ut jam de facto adjunctis:</hi> But thus did God (by the confeſſion of the Remonſtrants) decree the Reprobation and Damnation of Judas from all eternitie: The decree therefore of his Reprobation was abſolute.</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="S"/> Whereas therefore this Authour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumeth that he is able to <hi>convince the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of a tempted man that he is no Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate;</hi> if he mean he can convince him that he ſhall not be damned if he repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, we can do the ſame: But if he mean (as he muſt do, if he will free the tempted perſon from his perplexitie after his way) that he is able to convince him that he is none of thoſe in whom God eternally fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw finall impenitencie, that he is none of thoſe whom God upon this foreſight eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reprobated; I dare ſay, he is able to do that which neither S. Paul nor S. Peter were able to do: And therefore we are not aſhamed to profeſſe, that we cannot attein to this skill. And I think that if any tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man ſhould put a Remonſtrant to his <hi>oath</hi> or <hi>proteſtation</hi> whether he indeed can aſſure him that he is no Reprobate, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own doctrine of eternall Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, he would not dare to take ſuch an oath. He might ſafely ſwear unto him, that he neither is nor ſhall be thrown from the face of God into hell, if he repent: but
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:135677:247"/> he cannot ſafely ſwear unto him, that he ſhall repent, or that God upon the foreſight of his ſtubbornneſſe did not from all eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty abſolutely appoint him unto damnation.</p>
                  <p>And were it poſſible for a Remonſtrant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="T"/> Miniſter to perſwade ſuch a deſperate wretch of his future repentanc and faith, yet this is not <hi>demonſtrative to convince</hi> him that he is no Reprobate.

                  <p>We willingly grant, that we cannot, <hi>to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="V"/> the ſilencing of all replies,</hi> from the <hi>outward ſeeming acts of faith and repentance</hi> prove a man to be a <hi>true believer,</hi> to be a perſon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, to be <hi>no Reprobate:</hi> But we can do as much upon the grounds of our doctrine as any Remonſtrant can upon his, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more: becauſe in his doctrine men ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, ſanctified, adopted may become Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, and ſo be damned in the end.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Piſcator</hi> ſaith is thus farre forth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="X"/> true, That <hi>no comfort</hi> from aſſurance of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,

               <p>IT now remaineth that for a cloſe of all we ſpeak ſomething concerning the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe of the doctrine of Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and of the right uſe of the ſame.

Thus we conceive them to do who at the firſt ſtep do bring carnall men to the contemplation of this great depth of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Reprobation, who ought in the firſt place to be called to faith in Chriſt and to ſerious repentance: which is all one as if a man ſhould purpoſely give to a ſick and weak perſon ſtrong and ſolid meat which his ſtomach is not able to bear, contrary to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age,</hi>

                  <hi>even thoſe who by reaſon of uſe have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern both good and evil.</hi> We ought therefore to imitate the practice of Chriſt and of the
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:135677:249"/> Apoſtles, and to preach the Goſpel in the ſame order which our Maſter and thoſe moſt skilfull builders did follow. But in what manner did our Saviour Chriſt inſtruct men to life eternall? We have a notable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample John 3.16. where in the firſt place he teacheth, That God ſo loved the world that he gave his Sonne for the redemption of mankind. Then he addeth, That every one who believeth in this Redeemer ſhall obtein life everlaſting; but thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not ſhall therefore periſh becauſe they believed not in the Sonne of God. Hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we have not one word concerning the myſterie of Election and Reprobation. But afterwards, when Chriſt ſaw ſome by the preaching of the Goſpel brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, faith and holineſſe of life, leſt they ſhould attribute unto themſelves theſe effects of ſpeciall grace and mercie, he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto them the deep myſterie of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and telleth them how all thoſe graces flowed from the decree of Predeſtination.

                  </gap>hey have laid down the order of the Divine decrees as a thing whereof they had certain knowledge, affirming this to have been the firſt decree of the Divine will, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, another the third, and ſo on, at length they ſtick not to avouch, that if God had not obſerved this very order which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of, he ſhould have done either un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſely or unjuſtly. A wiſe Miniſter ſhould wholly abſtein from handling theſe thorny queſtions: however the buſineſſe never ought to come to that point, that if we fail in theſe our ſpeculations, any reproch ſhould be faſtened upon God himſelf. The Miniſters of the word therefore, as oft as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is offered of treating of Predeſtination
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:135677:251"/> before the people, muſt be content to contein themſelves within thoſe bounds which the holy Scripture hath clearly chalk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out unto us. Let them teach, how God elected his own unto life eternall before the foundations of the world were laid. Let them teach, how this Election flowed not from the foreſight of mans merits, but from the free will and gracious pleaſure of God electing. Let them teach, that whatſoever ſaving good is found in us, is the effect of this free and gracious mercy. Let them teach, that the aſſurance of our Election is not to be ſought in Gods ſecret decrees or our own idle imaginations, but in the effects and operations of the faithfull and ſanctified ſoul. Theſe and other ſuch doctrines which are clear, ſound and profitable, may and ought be preached unto Chriſtians. But thoſe which are either too knotty or elſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together fruitleſſe (eſpecially when they are not clearly grounded and revealed in the word of God) ought quite to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of vulgar congregations. And here I cannot but tax the folly and raſhneſſe of ſome (eſpecially young) Preachers, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as they heare any new controverſie concerning Predeſtination ſtarted amongſt Divines, be it never ſo intricate, never ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull, yet preſently they acquaint the people with it: This they preſſe, this they
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:135677:251"/> daily ſtand upon, and think it an argument of great learning to diſcuſſe thoſe points a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the unlearned, which their auditours do not at all underſtand. Againſt theſe may we take up that of the ſonne of Sirach,<note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ecclus</hi> 19.12.</note> 
                  <hi>A fool travelleth with a word as a woman in labour of a child: as an arrow that ſticketh in a mans thigh, ſo is a word in a fools belly.</hi> This abuſe therefore is chiefly to be avoided by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the word; who as they may deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſimple, clear and fundamentall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Predeſtination with profit and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to the people of God rightly train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, ſo can they not run out into intricate queſtions, and curiouſly diſcuſſe both ſides of the controverſie after the manner of the Schools, but by this their ſuperfluous dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence they muſt needs train up their people rather unto curioſity and itch of contention, then unto faith and zeal of a godly life. Yea, what Prudentius ſaid of wrangling ſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters may well be applyed unto theſe men;
<q>Fidem minutis diſsecant ambagibus,</q> They mince the faith into petty circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Or rather that of the Apoſtle,<note n="i" place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4</note>

                     </gap>h envy, ſtrife,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as we do worthily blame thoſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> who offend by doing too much, ſtretching this doctrine of Predeſtination to intricate &amp; ſuperfluous queſtions; ſo alſo are they no leſſe
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:135677:252"/> to be taxed who ſeem to offend by doing too little, while they propound Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; Reprobation to the people in the effect onely or the event, that is, the infallible ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Elect, and the infallible da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnation of the Reprobate; in the mean time little regarding, or at leaſt not with the ſame diligence acquainting the people with the means whereby the Elect are brought unto ſalvation, and the means whereby the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates do ruſh headlong into deſtruction: whereas indeed it is a dangerous matter to lay open before the eyes of the vulgar the naked and bare doctrines of Predeſtination and Reprobation. A wiſe Miniſter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will never teach the people that ſome particular perſons are abſolutely predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto life, but withall he will let them know that theſe perſons are none other but ſuch as by faith and holineſſe do walk in the way to eternall life. He will never teach that ſome particular perſons were paſſed-by in this infallible ordination unto life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but withall he will alſo ſhew that theſe are none other but they who by their own voluntary impenitency, infidelity and impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty did moſt deſervedly pull upon themſelves eternall deſtruction. So Paul delivereth this doctrine of Predeſtination, Rom. 8. where having made mention of Predeſtination, he preſently annexeth thereunto Vocation, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:135677:252"/> Sanctification, without which we ought not ſo much as to dream of our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, at leaſt we cannot come to any certain evidence thereof. So likewiſe Epheſ. 1. unto the doctrine of Predeſtination he joyneth Sanctification and other ſpirituall gifts, which are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, manifeſt tokens, of the predeſtinate. In like manner the point of Reprobation is ſo to be unfolded, that all may underſtand, that although by his ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all mercy God do not free the Reprobates from death, yet he forceth not any unto ſin, but they are carried headlong unto their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and that by their own voluntary motion. So Paul in his epiſtle to the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippians, when he ſpeaketh of the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,<note n="k" place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19</note> 
                  <hi>whoſe end is deſtruction,</hi> he addeth, <hi>whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory is in their ſhame, who mind earthly things.</hi> So Jude in his epiſtle ſpeaking of ſome<note n="l" place="margin">Jude v <hi>4.</hi>
                  </note> who <hi>were ordained to condemnation,</hi> he ſtraight addeth, that they were <hi>wicked men who turn the grace of God into laſciviouſneſſe, and deny the onely Lord God and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is not therefore the duty of a Miniſter, ſo to urge abſolute Predeſtination as in the mean time to forget the means: Becauſe although Gods decree concerning the ſalvation of this man, ſuppoſe Peter or Paul, be abſolute, yet the ſalvation of Peter and of Paul in regard of the event and fulfilling of the decree doth depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:135677:253"/> the conditionate uſe of the means. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the other ſide is the Reprobation of any particular perſons ſo to be preſſed, as though they were infallibly to be damned whatſoever they do: Becauſe the decree of Reprobating ſome doth not infringe the truth and ſtedfaſtneſſe of the Evangelicall promiſes made unto all and every one. For they hold true when they are in generall divulged in this form, <hi>Whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved:</hi> And they hold true al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo when they are applyed in ſpeciall to any particular perſon, <hi>If thou believeſt and leadeſt an holy life, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> To be ſhort, the ſaying of that moſt wiſe and learned Father is very neceſſary to be obſerved by all Miniſters of the word, who ſheweth,<note n="m" place="margin">Auguſt.

                  </note> That we may ſpeak that which is true concerning the abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Divine will to ſave and reprobate men, and yet not in that due manner in which we ought to ſpeak. For example; If a man ſhould ſpeak to his auditours to this purpoſe, <hi>Whether ye run or ſleep, whether ye receive the word into your hearts or reject it, yet in the concluſion ye ſhall all be ſuch as God who is invincible decreed ye ſhould be, as God who is infallible foreſaw ye would be,</hi> this is indeed a moſt true doctrine; But becauſe in the manner of propounding it ſeemeth to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the end from the means, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:135677:253"/> men to ſlothfulneſſe, in the judgement of S. Auguſtine<note n="n" place="margin">

We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed them all (as ye might obſerve) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der three heads: For either they are prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous, and deliver it to ſuch as are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable thereof; or elſe they ſtretch their diſcourſe beyond that fundamentall and ſimple doctrine delivered by the Apoſtle, and run out into intricate and curious ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations farre unfit for the peoples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; or laſtly they deliver it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively, barely and abruptly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the infallible end and abſolute event predetermined by God on either ſide, but ſpeaking not a word of the ſeverall means, conditions or wayes whereby thoſe ſeverall ends are atteined. But the decree of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ends is ſecret, and concerneth God more properly then men; but the precept about the means is revealed, and belongeth to men rather then to God: This therefore
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:135677:254"/> ought chiefly to be preſſed and inculcated by the Miniſters of the word. But from the Preachers let us proceed unto the people.</p>
               <p>Now men are wont to abuſe this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Predeſtination two manner of wayes; either unto preſumption, or unto deſpair. The preſumptuous, when they heare Predeſtination mentioned, as though they could gheſſe what God before the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the world determined concerning them, ſtraight without any premiſſes at all they conclude themſelves to be of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the predeſtinate. And to this raſh concluſion they annex this profane infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>Live as I will, ſince I am predeſtinate I ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Thus from raſhly preſuming what they pleaſe they proceed to live licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly as they pleaſe. On the contrary, the deſperate, aſſoon as they underſtand how ſome were elected ſome paſſed-by by God before the foundations of the world were laid, preſently conceiting ill of their own caſe they reckon themſelves among the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate. And to this blind conjecture they adde this wicked concluſion, <hi>Since I am none of the Elect, wherefore ſhould I trouble my ſelf by hearing Gods word, receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, mortifying my fleſh, and bringing forth the fruits of new life? for do I what I can I ſhall at length be damned.</hi> Thus theſe by deſpair do fall into the ſame ſlothfulneſſe and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:135677:254"/> of their ſalvation whereinto the others fell by preſumption. Both theſe abuſes ought moſt ſharply to be reproved, and withall the remedies are to be ſhewn where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be avoided. For the former, thoſe raſh preſumers are to be admoniſhed, that although <hi>in theſi,</hi> in the generall, it be moſt certain that God from all eternitie elected ſome rejected others, yet if we come down to particular perſons, it is a ſecret kept cloſe in Gods own breaſt, which be thoſe perſons that were deſtinated unto life, which be thoſe who are not comprehended in his gratious decree. It is therefore a very diabolicall temptation which moveth men to dive into the depth of Gods eternall decrees, and from thence to take up a raſh perſwaſion of their Predeſtination. For the decree of Predeſtination as it concerneth others is altogether by us unſearchable. Whence that of Proſper,<note n="p" place="margin">

                  <hi>Of God ſo farre as
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:135677:255"/> he is not revealed there is no faith, no ſcience, no knowledge. Leave off to muſe of God where he concealeth himſelf, if thou wouldeſt avoid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of blaſphemy. If thou believeſt in God revealed and receiveſt his word, he will alſo by little and little reveal unto thee God concealed. Sore not after things above thy reach, and ſearch not for what is above thy capacity: Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Sonne incarnate, and thy Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will quickly manifeſt it ſelf unto thee.</hi> Thus Luther. They flatly dote therefore who, as if they were of Gods privie counſel, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that they can be aſſured of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination before they have any knowledge of their converſion and juſtification. The onely remedie for this madneſſe is, that as they have been taught out of the word of God that ſome were elected, ſome paſſed-by, from all eternity, ſo they ſhould learn out of the ſame word, that no man either can or ought abſolutely conclude himſelf to be in the number of the elect before he find himſelf to be in the number of thoſe who are converted and do truly believe. Thus S. Paul,<note n="r" place="margin">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt depart from iniquitie.</hi> As if he had ſaid, God himſelf knoweth who are elected by looking into the ſecret decree of his own will: but thou, O man, whoſoever thou art, doſt not know that thou art elected but by
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:135677:255"/> departing from thy courſe of iniquitie. So ſaith Peter,<note n="ſ" place="margin">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.</note> 
                  <hi>Give diligence to make your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election ſure.</hi> For though it be moſt ſure and firm in the purpoſe of God electing, yet there can be no certaintie of the Election of any particular man, but onely of him that doth well. Laſtly, Epheſ. 1. (where the doctrine of Predeſtination is profeſſedly handled) the Apoſtle teacheth both theſe points, <hi>viz.</hi> That God<note n="t" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4.</note> 
                  <hi>choſe</hi> his <hi>before the foundation of the world;</hi> and, That we have not the aſſurance of this Election <hi>ſealed</hi> in our hearts till after that we have received the <hi>Goſpel</hi> into our hearts and <hi>believed in Chriſt.</hi> If thou obeyeſt Gods call,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 13.</note> thou mayeſt rightly conclude that thou waſt from all eternitie predeſtinated: If thou perſevere in thy unbelief and impietie, dream thou mayeſt or ſurmiſe that thou art prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated, know or believe thou canſt not. Away therefore with all raſh preſumption of Predeſtination, which is never begotten by the right unfolding of this doctrine, but by the fooliſh imagination of carnall men or the pernitious ſuggeſtions of the devil.</p>
               <p>Now let us weigh the inference which ſuch preſumptuous men do uſe to make: <hi>Live as I will,</hi> ſay they, <hi>ſince I am predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted I ſhall be ſaved.</hi> I will not further ſtand to examine the raſhneſſe of this preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:135677:256"/> having ſpoken ſufficiently thereof alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Let it be granted that ſuch an one is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed predeſtinated, yet nothing can be more wicked, nothing more fooliſh, nothing more falſe then this concluſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, it is a certain token of a wicked wretch, not of an elected perſon, to take occaſion of ſinning from that which ſhould have encouraged him to holineſſe of life. He who ſaith in his heart, <hi>I am predeſtinated,</hi> what ſaith he elſe but this, <hi>God out of his mere good pleaſure hath ordained me to eternall life?</hi> but he who hence doth gather, <hi>Therefore I may live as I liſt,</hi> what ſaith he but this, <hi>Therefore I may of ſet purpoſe run headlong to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hell?</hi> But how can he who is not more wicked then Wickedneſſe it ſelf reaſon thus, <hi>Becauſe I believe that God was thus ſpecially gratious towards me, therefore I will ſhew my ſelf exceedingly unthankfull towards him: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God hath decreed to bring me to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heaven, therefore I will trie if I can maugre his decree caſt my ſelf into the pit of hell.?</hi> Profane and godleſſe men, who turn the grace of God into wantonneſſe, may ſometimes perhaps out of a conceited opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their Predeſtination fall into this deſperate madneſſe: But for a truly regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and faithfull man, whoſe heart is aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the holy Ghoſt that he is the ſonne of God and ordained from all eternitie to
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:135677:256"/> the participation of the kingdome of heaven, it is as impoſſible that he from the ſenſe and perſwaſion of his Predeſtination ſhould draw this wicked concluſion, as for wood to be cold in the middle of the fire, or the aire to be dark when the ſun-beams are diffuſed through it.<note n="u" place="margin">1. <hi>John</hi> 3.3.</note> 
                  <hi>Every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himſelf,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Therefore they that defile themſelves with all manner of luſts, come farre ſhort of a true perſwaſion of their being elected.</p>
               <p>Secondly, nothing is more fooliſh then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the foreſaid inference. For as it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wiſdome to chooſe and uſe fit and proper means for the obteining of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed end; ſo it is the height of folly, from the appointment of the end to inferre a refuſing or neglect of the means. We will explain this by ſome ſpeciall examples. God had decreed from eternitie, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over revealed unto Abraham, that in his ſeed all nations ſhould be bleſſed. Now ſuppoſe that Abraham preſuming upon this decree had reſolved wholly to abſtein from the company of Sarai his wife, and had thus reaſoned with himſelf, <hi>Whatſoever I do or not do, God will take care for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of his own decree;</hi> it would be hard to ſay whether ſuch reaſoning were more guiltie of folly or of wickedneſſe. In like manner, if Ezekiah, after notice of Gods
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:135677:257"/> decree to prolong his life fifteen years, ſhould thereupon have determined with himſelf from thence forward neither to eat nor drink nor do any thing elſe that is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the preſervation of mans life, who could excuſe him from extreme madneſſe? Accordingly, ſhould we grant that ſuch a particular man were elected by God unto life eternall; ſhould we further grant the ſame man to have certain knowledge of his Election, not by faith onely and the ſecret teſtimonie of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but by the voice of God himſelf clearly ſounding from heaven; yet after ſuch an extraordinary revelation of his Election to neglect the means leading to ſalvation, and ſupinely to expect by power of the Divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to be drawn to the uſe of them whether he will or no, would be a manifeſt argument not of an elected but of a brainleſſe perſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, nothing is more falſe then this manner of reaſoning, <hi>I am predeſtinated; Therefore whether I believe or not believe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I live well or ill, I ſhall be ſaved.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Predeſtination of a man being granted, his ſalvation muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, yet it followeth not upon every condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For example; That Paul was elected to ſalvation from all eternity, is moſt true: yet if any ſhould argue thus, <hi>Therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had been converted unto Chriſt or had
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:135677:257"/> perſevered in his blaſphemy againſt him, he had been ſaved,</hi> he would inferre a moſt falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. For if theſe reaſonings were true, the preaching of the Goſpel would be in vain, the adminiſtration of the Sacraments ſuperfluous, our converſion, juſtification, ſanctification idle and frivolous: for Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination alone would carry a man to heaven whether he would or no. But ſuch dreams as theſe are to be avoided: For the decree of Predeſtination about the end to be obtein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed doth not exclude but include the means and ordinary way whereby men tend to that end. This conditionall propoſition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Although Paul continue in unbelief, he ſhall be ſaved,</hi> is ſo farre from following upon the doctrine of Predeſtination, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory thereof may thence be deduced, namely, <hi>If Paul believe not, it is impoſsible he ſhould be ſaved.</hi> The reaſon is manifeſt: Becauſe the ſame God who decreed to ſave Paul, decreed to ſave him by faith, not by impenitence and unbelief. This may very well be illuſtrated by that purpoſe of God to ſave all thoſe from ſhipwrack who ſailed together with S. Paul towards Rome: For though God had infallibly decreed to deliver all theſe men, and by an<note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 27.24.</note> angel had revealed this his decree unto Paul, yet the Apoſtle cryeth out,<note n="y" place="margin">
                     <hi>v.</hi> 31.</note> 
                  <hi>Except the mariners abide in the ſhip, they cannot be ſaved.</hi> The ſame ſay we
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:135677:258"/> concerning the Predeſtination of any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſons unto life eternall: Although it be infallibly decreed by God, although it be clearly evidenced to the perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet can they not bee ſaved except they abide in faith and godlineſſe. The do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Predeſtination therefore permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not any man to perſwade himſelf that his ſalvation is certain before he find that he is truly converted, truly faithfull, truly ſanctified. Much leſſe doth it permit men to preſume, that following their luſts and living wickedly, they may nevertheleſſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein the kingdome of heaven. And thus much concerning the former abuſe.</p>
               <p>Now let us come to them who from the doctrine of Predeſtination take occaſion to deſpair, and conclude from thence, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they believe in Chriſt, and lead their lives never ſo holily, notwithſtanding by reaſon of the infallibility of the Divine decree they ſhall at length be damned. Firſt let us conſider how ill theſe mens perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Reprobation is grounded: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, what an ill conſequence this is, That though they believe and follow good works yet their damnation is certain. For the firſt, I would fain know what argument of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair any Chriſtian can draw from this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, That God before the foundations of the world were laid did paſſe thoſe decrees
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:135677:258"/> of Predeſtination and Reprobation in the ſecret counſel of his own will. For firſt even reaſon it ſelf forbiddeth us in matters whereof we are altogether ignorant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine any thing on either ſide: Now what God did before the creation of the world is a point ſo deep and unſearchable, that to go about by conjecture to dive into it is even as if man a poore earthworm ſhould attempt to ſcale heaven with a ladder. Here we may well take up that Exod. 19.12. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves that ye go not up into the mount or touch the border of it: whoſoever toucheth the mount, ſhall be ſurely put to death.</hi> Hilary ſaith very well,<note n="z" place="margin">

                  <hi>We are to pry no further into the Divine reaſon then it hath pleaſed to reveal it ſelf to our underſtanding.</hi> Now this it giveth us to underſtand, that ſome were elected, ſome reprobated: but who are elected who repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, it ſuffereth us not to know. But fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, though any man were ſo raſh and heady as that he could not moderate himſelf but muſt needs peep beyond the written word in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe eternall and hidden actions of God, yet from theſe his moſt uncertain conjectures to preſcribe himſelf a rule what to do or not do, were madneſſe void of all reaſon. For let us put caſe, that a battel were to be waged between two armies, and God by ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had revealed that the farre greater part of the ſouldiers ſhould periſh in the fight,

Without doubt he may blame himſelf for taking occaſion (where no juſt one was given) from the foreſaid revelation. The very ſame we may think of thoſe who from the doctrine of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination and Reprobation ſet forth in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall do take occaſion to thruſt themſelves into the number of thoſe that are repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and ſhall certainly periſh, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to neglect their ſpirituall armour, to offer their throat to the devil, and wilfully to plunge themſelves into the pit of hell.<note n="a" place="margin">De nullius hominis ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum quem Dei patientia ſinit vive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; de ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipſius mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimè omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.

                  </gap>y, although (as we touched formerly) before true converſion and ſanctification no man can obtein either any certaintie of his Election or any true feeling and lively com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, yet the doctrine of eternall Election doth not afford to a Chriſtian any probable conjecture whence he may gather that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in particular is one of the non-elect: yea rather any one that liveth within the pale of the Church, although yet uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, may learn ſo much from thence as may and ought move him rather to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive himſelf to be one of thoſe whom God from all eternitie elected to everlaſting life. It is a commonly received rule amongſt Divines, <hi>De quolibet homine praeſumendum eſt bonum donec conſtet contrarium,</hi> We ought to hope well of every one untill we know the contrary. If we ought not out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture to conclude any thing amiſſe of others, then ought we not of our ſelves. But let us ſee now how many reaſons there be which may keep a Chriſtian from thus deſpairing. If thou art a Chriſtian, thou haſt God by the Goſpel calling thee; thou haſt the Sonne of God in the Goſpel offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and together with him remiſſion of ſinnes and life eternall; thou haſt the Spirit
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:135677:260"/> of God ſtanding and knocking at the doore of thy heart; thou haſt many other things, which though they be not ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate infallibly to a man that he is elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed while yet he believeth not and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unſanctified, yet they ought abundantly to demonſtrate thus much to any man, that he neither can nor ought have any precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit that he is reprobated. But they object, <hi>God indeed doth offer the outward means unto me; but ſince I am none of his elect, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver impart unto me the pretious gift of faith.</hi> How knoweſt thou that? Ask thou faith of God, and uſe diligently the means ordained for the begetting of faith, and thou maiſt be confident that thou art neither ſhut out of Gods Predeſtination nor ſhalt finally be kept deſtitute of the gift of faith. But if any do ſo ſtiffly perſwade himſelf that he is a reprobate as withall to caſt off all care of his ſalvation, he hath enterteined this perſwaſion into his breaſt without all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and he neglecteth the means againſt all religion. But this doctrine of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and Reprobation is no more to be concealed or relinquiſhed becauſe ſuch as theſe do thus waiwardly abuſe it, then the doctrine of the Trinitie is becauſe the Jews and Mahometanes deride and reject it.</p>
               <p>Having therefore confuted this raſh and impious perſwaſion, let us examine a little
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:135677:260"/> the concluſion which they infer from it, viz. That although they do believe the Goſpel, and live never ſo holily, yet for all that they ſhall be damned, by reaſon of the infallible decree of the Divine will. I anſwer, There was never in the Divine will any ſuch decree as theſe men imagine, of damning any man though he ſhould believe and live righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. Yea, God hath eſtabliſhed and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed unto all men a quite contrary decree, That<note n="b" place="margin">

                  <hi>there is no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit.</hi> The doctrine therefore of Gods ſecret decree of Predeſtination and Reprobation can afford no comfort to any man before he knoweth that he is in Chriſt and is become a new creature: neither can it drive any man to deſpair who believeth the Goſpel and is carefull to lead a godly life; becauſe ſuch a care is a conſequent fruit of Election.

<pb n="516" facs="tcp:135677:261"/> unſearchable myſtery; which to go about by curious ſearch or mere conjectures to pry into, is both extremely fooliſh and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. We muſt alwayes therefore have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the word revealed, the which when we believe and obey, we do ſafely draw out from thence this comfortable concluſion <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> from the effects, That we are Gods choſen children: But as long as we abide in infidelity and unconverted, it is folly to preſume we are elected, madneſſe to conclude we are reprobated, whereas the will of God hath as yet by no externall effect evidently manifeſted it ſelf unto us on either ſide. Hitherto of the abuſes of this doctrine: Now let us proceed to ſhew the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thereof.</p>
               <p>Here in the firſt place I premiſe this, That they are in no wiſe to be hearkned unto who conceive that this doctrine of Election and Reprobation ought therefore to be quite buried in ſilence, becauſe profane and way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward men do abuſe it either to preſumption and licentiouſneſſe or to deſpair and rech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe. If the former cautions be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That we neither deliver it unſeaſonably to thoſe that are uncapable, nor immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſtretch it to curious ſpeculations, nor propound it to the people by halves and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectively, then it is clear and evident that this doctrine ought to be preached. Firſt,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:135677:261"/> becauſe Chriſt and his Apoſtles taught it publickly, notwithſtanding the wickedneſſe of carnall men: And it is farre ſafer from their example to learn what is profitable to be taught and what not, then from humane reaſonings. Secondly, becauſe Election is a ſingular benefit of God, and the foundation of all other gifts which tend to ſalvation: And it is the part of unthankfull men to deſire to conceal ſuch an eſpeciall favour becauſe wicked and ungodly men are trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to heare of it. Laſtly, becauſe this very doctrine doth exceedingly encourage the faithfull and godly to proceed in their courſe of faith and godlineſſe, of whom more regard ought to be had then of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane wretches who are wont to pervert all things to their own deſtruction. For we ought not ſo much to fear leſt thoſe who have no mind to embrace the truth ſhould be offended at our doctrine, as leſt while we conceal the truth of this myſtery ſuch as both are able and willing profitably to lay hold on it, ſhould in the mean time be ſurprized with errour. But now let us ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe our ſelves to unfold the uſes of this doctrine.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place it ſerveth to illuſtrate <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> many of Gods Attributes, and exceedingly manifeſteth thoſe Divine properties which every Chriſtian ought rightly to know and
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:135677:262"/> acknowledge, and which they who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne this doctrine can never acknowledge as is meet. I will briefly run over ſome of the chief of them. Firſt, Gods infallible and eternall Preſcience of contingent events and of all the actions of free agents, is ſuch a property as by granting or denying where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we grant or deny a Diety. Wherefore Iſai. 44.7. God doth challenge the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of future events to himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and denieth it to all the gods of the heathen. Now this Preſcience is ſo linked together with the doctrine of Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he who granteth or denieth either muſt needs by conſequence grant or deny both. Further, an abſolute Dominion and Sovereignty over all the creatures and their actions, eſpecially over the wills and actions of men, is ſo proper unto God, that he is not to be held for a God who cannot bend and incline the wills of men which way he pleaſe, and that without any violence offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their naturall freedome. But if we reject the doctrine of abſolute Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt withall of neceſſity abbridge God of his abſolute power over the wills of men. It is therefore no ſmall uſe that we make of this doctrine, when we learn from thence that God hath an omnipotent power of turning the hearts of men which way he pleaſe. Moreover, the Immutability of the
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:135677:262"/> Divine will is held to be another of Gods principall attributes. <hi>The Lord of hoſts hath purpoſed, and who ſhall diſannull it?</hi> Iſai. 14.27. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not,</hi> Mal. 3.6. Now what is Predeſtination but the eternall decree of this unchangeable will of God? For <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the immutability of his counſel,</hi> is ſeen in nothing ſo clearly as in it. Laſtly, we ought to acknowledge and admire in God a free and gracious Mercy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together undeſerved on the creatures part: and this attribute alſo doth ſhine ſo clear in the doctrine of Predeſtination, that thoſe who go-about to deny or obſcure it muſt withall be guilty of denying or obſcuring this mere and free mercy of God ſhewed in the ſalvation of man. If therefore we mean not to coyn a new God, we muſt not intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a new Predeſtination, but retein that which the holy Scripture hath delivered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. Let us look a little on Arminius and his followers. Theſe men reteining the bare name of Predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, have indeed brought in a Poſtdeſtination; yea under the empty ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Predeſtination they underſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but ſuch a purpoſe in God to bring the faithfull unto the kingdome of heaven and to ſhut out the unbelievers, as was then onely conceived by him, as it hath reference to particular perſons, when he foreſaw that they would perſevere unto the end either in
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:135677:263"/> faith or in unbelief. Now it is worth our pains to conſider how theſe men handle the foreſaid Divine attributes. Vorſtius being<note n="e" place="margin">Not. ad Diſp. de Deo, pag. <hi>328.</hi> &amp;c.</note> loth to admit of ſuch a Predeſtination as agreeth with Gods nature, hath ſhaped out a nature for God ſutable to that Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he dreamed of. Hereupon he queſtioneth all thoſe forementioned Divine attributes. The univerſall Preſcience he hotly oppoſeth under the perſon of others, not anſwering any thing to the objections al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged; but for the arguments of the ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox ſide, theſe he confuteth with might and main, or at leaſt endeavoureth to confute them. We will give you a taſt of the man.<note n="f" place="margin">

Auguſtine ſaith, That Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be preached to the end<note n="p" place="margin">
                     <hi>De bono perſever. c. 21.</hi> ut poſsit vera Dei gratia inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabili mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitione de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſendi.</note> 
                  <hi>that Gods true grace may have an invincible bulwork to defend it.</hi> It is manifeſt therefore that this
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:135677:264"/> is one ſpeciall uſe of the doctrine of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, To learn from thence to conceive aright of the Divine attributes, which they who reject it cannot poſſibly do. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is much to be feared, leſt thoſe who diſallowing S. Pauls Predeſtination em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace that of Arminius, will at length alſo like well of Vorſtius his God, hewed out and ſquared for the moſt part by the rule of Arminius his Predeſtination. Thus much of the firſt uſe of this doctrine.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the doctrine of Predeſtination <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> doth ſerve to kindle in the hearts of the faithfull a moſt ardent love towards God. For what more effectuall motive can there be to move a man unto love then to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by the love and bounty of another. Now onely the orthodox doctrine of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination doth ſtirre-up this love in the hearts of the elect, becauſe it alone doth teach that God did freely love them from all eternity, and of his ſpeciall favour loaded them with his gratious benefits. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the doctrine of Arminius ſheweth us how by believing and perſevering in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence men did firſt chooſe God before they were choſen by him, and did firſt ingage God by their ſingular obedience before they were by him endowed with any ſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. That this fruit doth ſpring from the ſenſe of our Election, Bernard hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:135677:265"/>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">Justus quis eſt niſi qui amanti ſe Deo vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditamoris? quod non fit niſi re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velante Spiritu per fidem homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni aeternum Dei propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ſuper ſua ſalute futura, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. 107.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Who is righteous, but he who requiteth the love of God with love again? Which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done except the holy Ghoſt reveal unto a man by faith Gods eternall purpoſe concerning his future ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, this doctrine is a great ſpurre and encouragement to the ſtudy of true god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe unto all thoſe who are affected with a lively ſenſe of their Election. For as ſoon as the heart of a man beginneth to glow with the love of God, preſently he hath an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deſire of glorifying God by his good works and of teſtifying his thankfulneſſe. Howſoever therefore ſometimes thoſe that prattle much of their Predeſtination are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent &amp; ſluggiſh, yet ſuch as have obteined a true and lively ſenſe thereof are fervent and zealous of good works. Neither indeed can it be otherwiſe: For no man can by the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of faith and teſtimony of the Spirit apprehend that he is elected, but withall he muſt apprehend thus much, that he is elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the end he may be holy and unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able before God through love; that he is created anew unto good works, which God hath prepared for him that he ſhould walk in them; in a word, that he is ordained as well unto the works of grace as to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of glory. But he abhorreth and repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth farre from him that profane cogitation, <hi>I am predeſtinated; therefore I may live as I liſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="525" facs="tcp:135677:265"/>
               <p>The fourth uſe of this doctrine is this, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> That it is a ſpeciall means to beat down the pride of man, and to beget in him true humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. For whereas it is the nature of man to deſire ever to have ſomething in himſelf, though never ſo ſmall, whereby he may ſeem to have deſerved Gods favour before others, or at leaſt by merit of congruity to have obteined it; this doctrine telleth us roundly, that whatſoever good any of us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath or can, it all proceedeth from the ſpeciall and free bounty of God. What man therefore can boaſt of his own ſtrength who is forced to acknowledge that all the good that is in him hath God for its authour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver and finiſher, and that out of his ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all good purpoſe and love? What man can chooſe but think meanly of himſelf, and humble himſelf before God, who is perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that no man, though indued with ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall perfection, can ever attein life ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting but by virtue of Gods Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Whence S. Auguſtine upon that of the Pſalmiſt,<note n="r" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 85.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Shew us thy mercy, O Lord,</hi> ſaith thus, <hi>Happy is the man to whom God ſheweth his mercy: He can in no wiſe be lifted up with pride to whom God ſheweth his mercy. For by ſhewing his mercy unto him, he perſwadeth him that whatſoever good he hath, he hath it from none but him who is our univerſall good. And when he conſidereth that he hath all that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyeth
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:135677:266"/> not from himſelf but from his God, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering hereof he waxeth not proud, not wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proud he is not lifted up, not being lifted up he falleth not, not falling he ſtandeth, ſtanding he adhereth unto, adhering unto he abideth in, abiding in he enjoyeth and rejoyceth in the Lord his God.</hi> Thus Saint Auguſtine. And more briefly in another place,<note n="ſ" place="margin">
                     <hi>De bono perſev. lib. 2. c. 20.</hi> Praedican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da eſt prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinatio iſta benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciorum Dei, ut qui ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet aures audiendi, non in ſeip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſed in Domino g lorietur.</note> 
                  <hi>This decree of God of beſtowing his benefits ought to be declared, that he that hath ears to heare may not glory in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf but in the Lord.</hi> This uſe of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Apoſtle himſelf intimateth in thoſe words, Epheſ. 1.6. <hi>He hath predeſtinated us to the praiſe of the glory of his grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, this orthodox doctrine of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination and Reprobation doth arm the faithfull againſt diffidence, and againſt all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the temptations and aſſaults of Satan where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he laboureth to throw them into deſpair. This uſe of this doctrine our Saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Apoſtles have in divers places commended unto us. Luke 12.32. <hi>Fear not, little flock: for it is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the kingdome.</hi> The ſame ſcope had the Apoſtle. Rom. 8. where having laid down the doctrine of Predeſtination, he ſtraight endeavoureth from thence to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the godly and faithfull againſt whatſoever any wayes may moleſt and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them, and draw them into diſtruſt or any danger. For what elſe do thoſe comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:135677:266"/> ſpeaches breath out, <hi>If God be for us who can be againſt us?</hi> verſ. 31. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect?</hi> verſ. 33. <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt?</hi> verſ. 35. <hi>In all theſe things we are more then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querers through him that loved us. For I am perſwaded that neither death, nor life, nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,— nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> verſ. 37. &amp;c.? This therefore is the moſt true and wholeſome uſe of our Predeſtination, not to feed our minds with the idle ſpeculation thereof, but to ſuſtein, refreſh and ſtrengthen them with firm hope and faith, when they labour and grone and are diſcouraged, under the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world, the infirmities of the fleſh, and the aſſaults of the devil. I am not ignorant that the ancient Pelagians and ſome late adverſaries of abſolute Predeſtination do reaſon farre otherwiſe with themſelves; namely on this manner, If Predeſtination and Reprobation depend upon the acts of our free-will; if grace be tendred promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly unto all men, and it be left to our choice whether we will believe or not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, perſevere or not perſevere, then let us take good courage: for ſince our will is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe of her own actions, no man can fall ſhort of ſalvation unleſſe he will. But then we muſt needs deſpair, when our ſalvation
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:135677:267"/> is wholly grounded upon the ſecret plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God, not upon our own free-will. Here we may well cry out with the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,<note n="t" place="margin">

                  <hi>Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; to be laid in the balance they are altogether lighter then va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> If thy ſalvation depended upon thine own will, then thou ſuppoſeſt thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rightly uſe the grace offered unto thee, and at length attein unto the kingdome of heaven. What Adam in his integrity did not, what the Angels placed in heaven and endued with heavenly perfections did not, when they were left unto their own liberty, that thou frail man, though overwhelmed with ſinne and battered continually with temptations, preſumeſt thou ſhouldeſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do if the Divine Predeſtination were quite removed, and the buſineſſe wholly left in thy power. On the other ſide thou complaineſt that by this doctrine thou art driven to deſpair, becauſe it placeth the whole oeconomie of mans ſalvation in Gods free pleaſure: As though then there were no remedy but men muſt deſpair when they are commanded to put all their confidence in God alone. But whatſoever hope the proud Pelagian can build upon the power of his own free-will, which is none at all, that and more can the righteous build upon the alone mercy of God, which is infinite.

Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding therefore all the calumnies of the Pelagians we avouch, that this is one ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all uſe of the orthodox doctrine of our Churches concerning Predeſtination, that by the ſhield of faith relying upon Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and unchangeable good will towards us we arm and protect our ſelves againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair and the fiery darts of the devil.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the conſideration of Election <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> doth ſtirre up the faithfull to conſtancie in prayer. For having learned that all good tending to ſalvation is prepared for them out of Gods good pleaſure, they are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by encouraged to call for and as it were to draw down from heaven by their prayers thoſe good things which from eternitie
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:135677:268"/> were ordained for the elect. For they know well, that prayer is the key of heaven, and that God doth not uſe to beſtow his ſaving graces upon lazie ſluggards, but upon ſuch as duly ſeek after them. Moreover, the ſame Spirit of Adoption which beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to our ſpirit that we are Gods choſen children, is alſo the Spirit of Prayer and Supplication, and enflameth our hearts to call daily upon our heavenly Father. Thoſe therefore who from the certaintie of their Predeſtination do pretend that the duty of prayer is ſuperfluous, do plainly ſhew that they are ſo farre from having any certaintie of their Predeſtination that they have not the leaſt ſenſe thereof. Aquinas ſpeaketh very learnedly and ſoundly,<note n="x" place="margin">
                     <hi>Part. 1. qu. 23. art. 8.</hi> Praedeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natis conan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt ad bene ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum &amp; orandum, quia per hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſmodi praedeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudin liter impletur.</note> 
                  <hi>The Elect ought to labour in good works and in prayer: for hereby their Election is aſcertained and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</hi>
                  <note n="y" place="margin">Idem ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>For as naturall effects, though foreſeen by God, yet are brought into act by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall cauſes, without which they cannot come to paſſe; ſo the ſalvation of the Elect being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by God, whatſoever furthereth the ſame falleth under the ſame decree, as prayer, care to live godlily, and the like, without which the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Elect will never be accompliſhed.</hi> By how much therefore the firmlier any man is perſwaded in his heart of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination, ſo much the greater ought his care to be of praying frequently unto God. For
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:135677:268"/> example; There was never any who more ſtrongly urged the doctrine of abſolute Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, never any who had more clear apprehenſion of his own Election, then the Apoſtle S. Paul, and yet this doctrine and apprehenſion did not (as the Pelagians falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm) withhold him from prayer, but made him more vehement and frequent in that duty. The ſame may we ſay of James, who is ſtyled the brother of the Lord: Without doubt he (if ever any other) had a moſt firm perſwaſion of the love of God and of his own Election, yet (as<note n="z" place="margin">Hiſt. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ. lib. 2. c. 23.</note> Euſebius recordeth) ſo did he wont himſelf to daily prayers, that his knees became hard and brawnie like the feet of a camel. To be ſlack and ſluggiſh therefore in prayer is not the propertie of thoſe who by the teſtimony of Gods Spirit have got aſſurance of their Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but rather of ſuch as have either none or very ſmall apprehenſion thereof. For aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as any one by believing doth conceive himſelf to be one of Gods elect children, he earneſtly deſireth to procure unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by prayer thoſe good things which he believeth that God prepared for his children before the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, it is manifeſt that when the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Predeſtination is rooted in our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> hearts, it doth exceedingly enable us pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:135677:269"/> and meekly to ſuſtein all adverſitie. Neither is this uſe lightly to be eſteemed, ſeeing that Patience, as Tertullian<note n="a" place="margin">De pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</note> ſaith, is <hi>a grace ſo neceſſary in all religious duties, that he that wanteth it can neither keep any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, nor perform any work acceptable to the Lord.</hi> Now the conſideration of Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination doth work patience in the Elect three manner of wayes. Firſt, becauſe from thence they conceive certain hope that their momentanie afflictions being ended they ſhall infallibly attein life everlaſting. Now what man into whoſe breaſt this perſwaſion is entred, that he was elected to life eternall before the creation of the world, can be of ſo low and cowardly a ſpirit as to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to impatience by the croſſes &amp; troubles of this temporall life? The Apoſtle encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged herewith crieth out thus in the midſt of his adverſitie,<note n="b" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18</note> That <hi>the ſufferings of this preſent time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> Holy Proſper, a diſciple of S. Paul, ſuſteineth himſelf with the ſame prop;<note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>In Sent.</hi> Appendo quod patior contra id quod ſpero, &amp; incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parabiliter majus eſt quod ſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quàm quod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertur.</note> 
                  <hi>I weigh,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>what I ſuffer with what I hope for, and my hopes do incomparably exceed all my ſufferings.</hi> Again, the Apoſtle Heb. 10.34. alledgeth the knowledge that the ſaints had of being elected to eternall life as a ſpeciall cauſe of their patience in enduring afflictions: <hi>Ye had compaſsion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:135677:269"/> the ſpoiling of your goods, knowing your ſelves that ye have in heaven a better and enduring ſubſtance.</hi> As though he had ſaid, Thoſe onely do patiently endure the loſſe of theſe earthly goods who know that there be heavenly goods appointed and prepared for them. Secondly, the conſideration of Predeſtination doth wonderfully conduce to the begetting of patience in the minds of the faithfull, becauſe whoſoever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth this doctrine aright, underſtandeth withall that he was elected not ſtraight to be carried into heaven on a bed of down, but to become conformable unto the Head of the Elect Chriſt Jeſus as well in the croſſe as in the crown, and firſt in the croſſe, after in the crown. For ſo ſaith the Apoſtle,<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17</note> 
                  <hi>If ſo be that we ſuffer with him, we ſhall be alſo glorified together.</hi> And S. Peter,<note n="e" place="margin">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13.</note>

                  </gap> not patience alone but joy alſo in affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions doth ſpring up unto the predeſtinate Thirdly, by the doctrine of Predeſtination the faithfull are trained up unto patience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe from thence they learn that all croſſes and troubles fall out unto them not by chance but by Gods determinate appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not according to the fury of the wicked but according to the will of their Father, laſtly, not for their hurt but for their advantage. No man hath throughly learned the doctrine of Predeſtination but he alſo acknowledgeth all this: and no man is firmly perſwaded of this, but he patiently endureth whatſoever misfortunes can befall him. But if at any time any impatience be found in the breaſt of the faithfull, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they either not ſufficiently believe or not attentively conſider this moſt comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able doctrine of Predeſtination. For if this perſwaſion be rooted in our hearts, That no man can do any thing againſt us but what the <hi>counſel of God determined before to be done,</hi>

Laſtly, if we take-in this alſo, That thoſe very things which ſeem hard and ſharp to be ſuffered do undoubtedly work together for our good, who would take I will not ſay impatiently but unwillingly a potion which, though bitter, yet is tempered and prepared for him by ſo wiſe, ſo loving a Phyſician?</p>
               <p>And thus you ſee how many excellent u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes do flow from the orthodox doctrine of Predeſtination. What remaineth ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in a word or two. If we will ſhew that we have not a fleeting or uncertain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture onely, but a true and ſolid know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Election, we muſt have recourſe to the forenamed uſes, and by them make triall whether our conceit of our Election be a deceitfull illuſion or a true perſwaſion ſpringing from faith.
